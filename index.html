                <h2>A Question of Distance</h2>
                <p class="lead">In 1888, as Jack the Ripper stalked the fog-shrouded streets of London's Whitechapel district, a small anglophone village in western Quebec was also confronting these horrors&mdash;through the pages of its local newspaper.</p>

                <div class="context-grid">
                    <div class="context-card">
                        <h3>Shawville</h3>
                        <p>Founded by Irish Protestant settlers after 1815, Shawville was incorporated as a municipality in 1873. By the 1880s, the arrival of the Pontiac and Pacific Junction Railway in 1886 had transformed this overwhelmingly anglophone community into a hub of the Pontiac region.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="context-card">
                        <h3>The Equity</h3>
                        <p>Established on June 7, 1883, by John Cowan and Henry Thomas Smith, <em>The Equity</em> began in nearby Bryson before moving to Shawville in October 1888&mdash;the very autumn of the Whitechapel murders. As "the Voice of the Pontiac," it brought world news to the village.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Between 1888 and 1895, <em>The Equity</em> carried reports of the Whitechapel murders, creating curious intrusions of metropolitan horror into the fabric of rural colonial life. These were more than mere news items&mdash;they were windows into how global events reached the hinterland, how British identity was constructed and maintained across an ocean, and how sensational crime bridged the distance between metropolis and colony.</p>

                <h2>Metropolis and Hinterland</h2>

                <p class="lead">What, then, does Jack the Ripper mean to Shawville?</p>

                <p>The Whitechapel articles in <em>The Equity</em> reveal the complex web connecting metropolis and hinterland in the late 19th century. They demonstrate how global news networks operated across vast distances, how sensational crime traveled through telegraph lines and steamship routes to reach rural readers within days or weeks of London events.</p>

                <p>More profoundly, they show how British identity was constructed and reinforced in an anglophone community within French Canada. The murders weren't just news&mdash;they were shared cultural reference points, affirming connections to the mother country even as Canada built its own national identity.</p>

                <p>These articles were indeed "motes of space-time"&mdash;moments when distant horror intruded into local life, when the violence of London's East End became conversation in Shawville's streets, when the metropolis reached into the hinterland and made itself felt.</p>

                <p>In studying these intrusions, we glimpse the information networks, cultural anxieties, and colonial relationships that shaped life in rural Quebec at the turn of the 20th century.</p>

                <h3>Data Collection</h3>
                <p>This project analyzes digitized issues of <em>The Equity</em> newspaper (1888-1895) from the Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec (BAnQ). Seven newspaper issues containing references to Whitechapel were identified through BAnQ's digital search tools.</p>

                <h3>Processing Pipeline</h3>
                <p>PDFs were processed using PaddleOCR for optical character recognition, followed by automated article segmentation, classification, and text analysis. The processing scripts are available in the project repository.</p>
