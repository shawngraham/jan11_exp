At the Government examinations last June the Mod- el school presented 23 pupils of whom all pas- sed. From the report of J. M. [Harper, Inspec- tor of Superior Schools, which is to be found in the Educational Record for October, we find that Clarendon surpassed Aylmer, Bry- son and Portage du Fort in the percentage for each pupil, and in appliances and specimens of work. The percentage for each pupil in Clarendon was seventy-nine per cent for ap- pliances and specimens of work 665 marks, whereas Aylmer, Bryson and Portage du Fort came below six-one per cent. for each pupil, and below 530 marks for appliances and speci- mens of work. Clarendon took the highest percentage in the province for each pupil ex- cept Bolton 83 per cent. and the highest marks for appliances and specimens of work except Waterville, 690 marks. The last meeting of the Council of Public Instruction voted a bon- us of $75 to the model school. We are grati- fied to learn that the past year has been one of marked success. We congratulate the com- missioners upon the excellent results both in the financial statement and in the examina- tions and heartily recommend the model school to the people of the county. 图: 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12 · 自己的 12",

It would be interesting to hear the other side of the story, and we doubt not ath when the matter comes to the notice of the ort. officers whose duty it is to look after the ter- on- ritory recently visited by Mr. Fitzpatrick. the they will be in a position to gratify the public rly on that score. 118- me- Eryson Bubbles. vas On Wednesday last the Registry office was est removed from itsold stand in the town hall. to more commodious and comfortable quart- ers rented for it in the Clifton House.

Miss Wright has been in our midst for B. over a year, and by her kind heartedness and he lady-like demeanor during that time has won the esteem and good will of all who have had at thep'easure of her acquaintance. As the time 8i- for her return to her home in Montreal is ap- proaching, the members of her Sabbath School n class took this means of expressing their ap- preciation of her assiduous efforts as their teacher.

The project should receive the hearty co-operation of the municipal councils of township Litchfield and Bryson, and the suggestions of X. Y. Z. be acted upon, as the construction of such a road would greatly facilitate ingress and egress to and from this town, and eventually lessen the of statute labor now borne by Le | Datacu or presente responsation source of the y, municipality of Litchfield.

Mr. Walker occupied the chair, and after a few in- o troductory remarks with regard to the na- n ture of the meeting, called on the Rev. Mr. Irving, of Portage-du-Fort. Mr. Irving spoke at some length and strongly urged upon the people the necessity of giving liberally for the advancement of missionary cause and missionary effort. The choir were then called 5 on for some music which they rendered in their usual excellent style, after which Mr. Wright, a student from Shawville, addressed the meeting. Collectors for the ensuing year were then appointed, and a unanimous vote of thanks tendered Misses N. Smith and Car- rie McDonald for the efficient manner in which they had carried out the work last year. The meeting was then brought to a close. Mr. George Carswell of Calumet Island was in town over Sunday, having returned from a business trip to Montreal, on Saturday night last. Miss Emma M.

      "headline": "RELATED BY THE GOVERNOR.",
      "full_text": "RELATED BY THE GOVERNOR. Martyrs to gout know, by sad experience, that they suffer under one of the most capri- cious of maladies. An attack of this dis- ease will shift, in the most unaccountable manner, from one part of the body to an- other; or it will release the victim when there is every reason to fear that it is about to strengthen its hold on him; or, having shown the fairest promise of submitting to medical treatment, it will cruelly lay the matient prostrate again in a state of relapse. Adverse fortune, in my case, subjected me to this last and worst trial of endurance. Two months passed-months of pain aggra- vated by anxiety-before I was able to help Eunice and Miss Jillgall personally with my sympathy and advice. During this interval I heard regularly from the friendly and faithful Selina. Terror and suspense, courageously endured day after day, seem to have broken down her resistance, poor soul, when Eunice's good name and Eunice's tranquility were threatened by the most infamous of false ac- cusations. From that time Miss Jillgall's method of expressing herself betrayed a gra- dual deterioration. I shall avoid presenting at a disadvantage a correspondent who has claims on my gratitude if I give the sub- stance only of what she wrote-assisted by a ma while the newspapers which she sent to me, while the legal proceedings were in progress. Honest indignation does sometimes coun- sel us wisely. When the doctor left Miss Jillgall in anger and in haste he determined on taking the course from which, as a hu- mane man and a faithful friend, he had hitherto recoiled. It was no time to shrink from the prospect of an exposure. The one hope of successfully encountering the vin- dictive wickedness of Helena lay in the resolution to be before hand with her in the appeal to the magistrates with which she had threatened Eunice and Miss Jillgall. The doctor's sworn information stated the whole terrible case of the poisoning, ranging from his first suspicions and their confirm- ation to Helena's atrocious attempt to accuse her innocent sister of her own guilt. So firmly were the magistrates convinced of the serious nature of the case thus stated that they did not hesitate to issue their warrant. Among the witnesses whose at- tendance was immediately secured by the legal adviser to whom the doctor applied were the farmer and his wife. Helena was arrested while she was dress. ing to go out. Her composure was not for for a moment disturbed. \"I was on my way,\" she said coolly, \"to make a statement before the justices. The sooner they hear what I have to say the better.\" The attempt of this shameless wretch to \"turn the tables 'on poor Eunice-suggest- ed, as I afterwards discovered, by the record of family history which she quoted in her journal-was defeated with ease. The farm- er and his wife proved the date at which Eunice had left her place of residence under as followed their roof. The doctor's evidence followed. He proved by the production of his profes- sional diary, that the discovery of the at- tempt to poison his patient had taken place before the day of Eunice's departure from the arm, and that the first improvements in Mr. Philip Dunboyne's state of health had shown itself after that young lady's arrival to perform the duties of a nurse. To the wise precautions which she had taken- perverted by Helena to the purpose of a false accusation—the doctor attributed the preservation of the young man's life. Having produced the worst possible im- pression on the minds of the magistrates, Helena was remanded. Her legal adviser had predicted this result; but the vindictive obstinacy of his client set both experience and remonstrance at defiance. At the renewed examination the line of de- fense adopted by the prisoner's lawyer prov- ed to be-mistaken identity. It was asserted that she had never enter- ed the chemist's shop; also, that the assist- ant had wrongly identified some other lady as Miss Helena Gracedieu; also, that there was not an atom of evidence to connect her with the stealing of the doctor's prescription paper and the forgery of his writing. Other assertions to the same purpose followed, on which it is needless to dwell. The case for the prosecution was, happily, in competent hands. With the exception of one witness, cross-examination afforded no material help to the evidence for the defense. The chemist swore positively to the per- sonal appearance of Helena as being the personal appearance of the lady who had presented the prescription. His assistant, pressed on the question of identity, broke down under cross examination-purposely, as it was whispered, serving the interest of the prisoner. But the victory so far gained by the defence was successfully contested by the statement of the next witness, a respectable tradesman in the town. He had seen the newspaper report of the first examination and had volunteered to present himself as a witness. A member of Mr. Gracedieu's congregation, his pew in the chapel was so situated as to give him a view of the minister's daughters occupying their pews. He had seen the prisoner on every Sunday for years past, and he swore that he was passing the door of the chemist's shop at the moment when she stepped out into the street, having a bottle covered with mary white paper in her hand.",

Melancholy news, again, was the news that I now heard. Mr. Dunboyne the elder had died sud. denly at his house in Ireland, while Philip was on his way home. When the funeral ceremony had come to an end the will was read. It had been made only a few days before the testator's death, and the clause which left all his property to his son was preceded by expressions of paternal affection at a time when Philip was in sore need of consolation. After alluding to a letter re- ceived from his son, the old man added: \"I always loved him without caring to con- fess it; I detest scenes of sentiment, kiss- ings, embracings, tears and that sort of thing. But Philip has yielded to my wishes and has broken off a marriage which would have made him, as well as me, wretched for life. After this I may speak my mind from my grave, and may tell my boy that I leved him. If the wish is likely to be of any use, I will add (on the chance) - God bless him.\" \"Does Philip submit to separation from Eunice?' I asked. \"Does he stay in Ire- land?\" \"Not he, poor fellow! He will be here to-morrow or next day. When I last wrote,\" Miss Jillgall continued, \"I told him I hoped to see you again soon.

If I try to do it I shall only cry, and we have had tears enough lately in this house.\" Further consultation being thus deferred, I went up stairs to the minister's room. He was sitting by the window, in his fa- vorite arm chair, absorbed in knitting! The person who attended on him, a good natured, patient fellow, had been a sailor in his young- er days and had taught Mr. Gracedieu how to use the needles. \"You see it amuses him,\" the man said kindly. \"Don't notice his mistakes; he thinks there isn't such an- other in the world for knitting as himself.\nYou can see, sir, how he sticks to it.\" He was so absorbed over his employment that I had to speak to him twice before I could in- duce him to look at me. The utter rum of his intellect did not appear to have exercised any disastrous influence over his bodily health. On the contrary, he had grown fat- ter since I had last seen him; his complexion had lost the pallor that I remembered—there was color in his cheeks. \"Don't you remem- ber your old friend,\" I said. He smiled and nodded and repeated the words. \"Yes, yes; my old friend.\" It was only too plain that he had not the least recollection of me. \"His memory is gone,\" the man said. \"When he puts away his knitting at night I have to find it for him in the morning. But, there! he him like a wet sponge over a slate.\" The old sailor was right. If that wreck of a man had been capable of feeling and thinking, his daughter's disgrace would have broken his heart. In a world of sin and sorrow is peaceable imbecility always to be piried? I have known men who would have answered without hesitation, \"It is to be envied,\" At breakfast, on the next day, the talk touched on those passages in Helena's diary which had been produced in court as evidence against her. I expressed a wish to see what revelation of a deprayed nature the entries in the diary might present, and my curiosity was grati- fied. At a fister time I may find an opportun- no me by the diary.

She blueh- ed as if the long lost days of her girlhood had been found again, and ran out of the room. \"Now, Mr. Philip,\" I said, \"I have been waiting, at Miss Jillgall's suggestion, to get my information from you. There is some thing wrong between Eunice and yourself. What is it? and who is to blame?\" \"Her vile sister is to blame,\" he answered.\n\"That reptile was determined to sting us, and she has done it !\" he cried, starting to his feet and walking up and down the room, sense of wrong. \"I say she has done it, when Eunice was ready to be my wife.\" \"How has she done it !\" Between grief and indignation his reply was involved in a confusion of vehemently spoken words which I shall not attempt to reproduce. Eunice had reminded him that her sister had been publicly convicted of an infamous crime, and publicly punished for it by imprisonment. \"If I consent to marry you,\" she said, \"I stain you with my disgrace; that shall never be.\" With this resolution she had left him. \"I have tried to convince her,\" Philip said, \"that she will not be associated with her sister's disgrace when she bears my name : I have promised to take her away, far away from England, among people who have never even heard of her sister. Miss Jillgall has used her influence to help me. All in vain! There is no hope for us but in you. I am not thinking selfishly only of myself. She tries to conceal it-but, oh, she is broken hearted! Ask the farmer's wife, if you don't believe me. Judge for yourself, sir. Go-for God's sake, go to the farm !\" I made him sit down and compose himself. \"You may depend on me going to the farm,\" I answered.\" \"I shall write to Eunice to day and follow my letter to- morrow.\" He tried to thank me, but I would not allow it. \"Before I consent to accept the expression of your gratitude,\" I said, \"I must know a little more of you than I know now. This is only the second occasion on which we have met. Let us look back a little, Mr. Philip Dunboyne. You were Eunice's affianced husband, and you broke faith with her. That was a rascally action. How do you defend it?\" His head sank. \"I am asnamed to de- fend it,\" he answered. I pressad him without mercy. \"You own yourself,\" I said, \"that it was a rascal- ly action?\" \"Use stronger language against me even than that, sir-I deserve it.\" \"In plain words,\" I went on, \"you can find no excuse for your conduct. \"In the past time,\" he said, \"I might have found excuses.\" \"But you can't find them now.\" \"I must not even look for them now.\" \" Why not?\" \"I owe it to Eunice to leave my conduct at its worst; with nothing said-by me-to defend it.\" \"What has Eunice done to have such a claim on you as that ?\" Eunice has forgiven me. It was gratefully and delicately said. From that moment (if it had not been too soon to trust him with the confession) I might have owned that I forgave him, too. But the duty yet lay before me of making myself acquainted with the circumstances from beginning to end of Eunice's melancholy love story. Justified by my own knowledge I might accept the position—the critical position, as I shall presently show-of Philip's friend. After more than an hour of questions put without reserve, and of answers given with-<br>out prevarication, I had travelled over the whole ground laid out by the narratives which appear in these pages, and had arriv- ed at my conclusion. There was Philip Dunboyne before me, resignedly waiting for my decision. A man with nothing absolute- ly wicked in him-but with a nature so perilously weak, in many respects, that it might drift into wickedness unless a strong- er nature was at hand to hold it back. Mar- ried to a wife without force of character, the probabilities would point to him as like- ly to yield to examples which might make him a bad husband. Married to a wife with a will of her own and with true love to sus- tain her-a wife who would know when to take the command and how to take the com- mand—a wife who, finding him tempted to commit actions unworthy of his better self, would be far-sighted enough to perceive that her husband's sense of homor might some- times lose its balance, without being on that account hopelessly depraved—then, and in these cases only, the probabilities would point to Philip as a man likely to be the better and the happier for his situation when the bonds of wedlock had got him. To the best of my ability I formed my judgment- and this, briefly stated, was the result. So I offered my hand to Philip and told him that he might consider me as his friend -with Eunice's best interests always held in reserve. My next proceeding was to shut myself up in my room and to seriously consider what course I should take when I went to the farm-house on the next day. Knowing what I alone knew, I held the marriage of these two young people at my disposal. I had only to relate what had happened on the day when the chaplain brought the minister to the prison, and the one obstacle to their union would be removed. I But, without considering Philip, it was simply out of the question to do this in mercy to Eunice herself. What was Helena's disgrace compared with the infamy which stained the name of the poor girl's mother? The other alternative of telling part of the truth only was before me if l could persuade myself to adopt it. Rashly enough, no doubt, I felt my decision to be influenced by the coming tinterview with Eunice.",

      "full_text": "The next day I drove to the farm. Philip's entreaties persuaded me to let him be my companion, on one condition-that he waited in the carriage while I went into the house. I had carefully arranged my ideas and had decided on proceeding with the great- est caution, before I ventured on saying the all important words which, once spoken, were not to be recalled. The worst of those anxieties, under which the delicate health of Mr. Gracedieuhad broken down was my anxiety now. Could I reconcile it to my conscience to permit a man innocent of all knowledge of the truth to marry the daughter of a condemned murderess with- out honestly telling him what he was about to do? Did I deserve to be pitied? did I deserve to be biamed ; My mind was been undecided when I entered the house. She ran to meet me as if she had been my daughter; she kissed me as if she had been my daughter; she fondly koked up at me as if she had been my daughter. At the sight of that sweet young face, so sorrowful, so patiently enduring sorrow, all my pre- pared talk, all my doubts and hesitations, everything artificial about me with which I had entered the room, vanished in an instant I was resolved, come what might of it, that she should marry Philip. Impulse in a man at the end of his life? Yes, impulse-and nothing else. After she had thanked me for coming to see her I saw her tremble a little. The uppermost interest in her heart was forcing its way outward to expression, try as she might to keen it back. \"Have you seen migne on wooh to person Philip ?\" she asked. I was utterly reckless; I owned that he was outside in the carriage. Before she could reproach me I went on with what I had to say: \"My child, I know what a sacrifice you have made, and I should honor your scruples if you had any reason for feel- ing them. \"Any reason for feeling them?\" She turned pale as she repeated the words. An idea came to me. I rang for the ser vant and sent her to the carriage to tell Philip to come in. \"My dear, I am not putting you to any unfair trial,\" I assured her; \"I am going to prove that I love you as truly as if you were my own child.\" When they were both present I resolved that they should not suffer a moment of need- less suspense. Standing between them, I took Eunice's hand and laid my other hand on Philip's shoulder and spoke out plainly. \"I am here to make you both happy,\" I said. \"I can remove the only obstacle to your marriage and I mean to do it. But I must insist on one condition. Give me your pro- mise, Philip, that you will be satisfied with the one true statement, which is all that I can offer to you.\" He gave me his promise without an in- stant's hesitation. \"Philip grants what I ask,\" I said to Eunice. \"Do you grant it too?\"\nHer hand turned cold in mine, but she spoke firmly when she said \"Yes.\" I gave her into Philip's care. It was his privilege to console and support her. It was my duty to say the decisive words : \"Rouse your courage, dear Eunice; you are no more affected by Helena's disgrace than I am. You are not her sister. Her father is not your father; her mother was not your mother. I was present, in the time of your infancy, when Mr. Gracendieu's fath- erly kindness received you as his adopted child. This, I declare to you both, on my word of honor, is the truth.\" How she bore it I am not able to say. My foolish old eyes were filling with tears. I could just see plainly enough to find my way to the door and leave them together. What had I done? That was not the question. I had done well if their happiness justified me. What had I concealed? I left Time to be my accomplice and keep",

Sam Small is the Prohibition candidate for State Senator in the Atalanta district, and his opponents are pouring hot shot into him at a lively rate. But he isn't abit scared, as witness: \"I am not running this race as a preacher, and no man need refrain from jumping on me on that account, It is but the convenient excuse of a coward.\" He also pleasantly refers to some of his accusers as \"Godless and ghoulish scoun- crels and villains whom it would be base flatttery to call doge.\" It is a thousand pities that some others of the American unjailed criminals now resid- ing in Canada could not be served in the same way as Pitcher has been served in Montreal. This man was teller of the Union Bank, of Providence, a position which he prostituted to his own purposes, by doing his best to wreck the bank. He escaped across the border before he could be brought to justice, but brought himself within the clutch of Canadian law by purchasing a bill of exchange with the money he had stolen. This furnished the desired evidence against him. He was arrested, tried on a charge of bringing stolen money into Canada, and has been sentenced to seven years in the pene- tentiary. The mystery of the so-called Jon magical mirrors, so far as the cause of /s ir reflecting objects that are on the back side of the mirror is concerned, appears to have yielded to a little painstaking investigation.\nThey are thin metal hand mirrors, with rais- ed figures on the back of them, and are cast of an alloy of about eighty parts copper and twenty of tin making a very hard yet elastic metal. In grinding the mirrors they are presumably laid on a flat plate, and the grinding pressure and the thick parts, op- posite the raised figures, are ground more rapidly; the pressure removed, the plate springs back, and the mirror is concave on the face where the figures are. The light reflected from this mirror will show the back, not from any magfcal power, but be- cause of the concave surface produced over the figures—the result of accident rather than of design. Robert Browning, we suppose, is univer- sally conceded to be a great and original po- etic genius. He is emphatically the \"one and only \" of his kind in existence at the present moment. He is not a poet who is easily \"understanded\" of the people. The people indeed as a rule know nothing about him. He is studied with some enthusiasm and much apparent admiration by certain quasi literary coteries who exalt him in their es- timation much in the same way perhaps, and for the same reason, as ignorant persons sometimes admire sermons, in inverse pre- portion to the degree in which they understand him. Harper's Magazine tells of a Browning Club in some Western State which seemed to be almost ashamed of itself and its cult, or it did not call itself by the name of him whose works it professed to study. The truth came out when the Club gave a recep- tion at which everything that could be was of brown colour.

There was a brewn table cloth, and brewn china, brown bread and brown sugar, brown dresses on the backs of the hostesses (the club is compes- ed of women,) and brown curtains on the windows. Altogether the affair seems to have been \"done up brown\" in a masterful sort of way. The diary of the Emperor Frederick is caus- ing more and more stir, not only in Germany but all over the world.

      "full_text": "Russian Religion. One of the first things that strikes the stranger in St. Petersburg, and still more in Moscow, is the constant crossing that goes on in the streets. Whenever a devout Russian passes a church or a shrine or a holy altar he lifts his hat and crosses himself in the fashion of the Eastern Church. In Moscow the number of shrines is so great and the sanctity of some of them so over- powering that it must be difficult for the de- vout orthodox to get along the street. In St. Petersburg the number is much less, but it is still sufficient to keep your isvostchik's arms in tolerably active exercise. One thing puzzled me much. In St. Petersburg the women very seldom crossed themselves. For one woman who would make the sign of the the entrance to the Gostinnoi Dvor Sullue at the entrume it would be made by a dozen men, In Mos- cow the women were more careful to perform their devotions, but in St. Petersburg the males were much more devout to outward seeming than the women. Of the women who did obeisance to the holy places in St. Petersburg all were poor. I did not see one well-dressed lady cross herself in the streets all the time I was in Russia. Officers and gentlemen were not so particular as the isvostchiks and workmen, but it was no un- common sight to see them making the sign of the cross. I traveled with Gen. Ignatieff from St. Petersburg to Moscow. The mo- ment the train started the General crossed himself twice, remarking that although you should always pray, it was especially incumbent upon you to do so when starting on a journey. The number of shrines in Russia where candles are burning before noty pictu res is very great, and much greater importance is attached to the science of genuflexion than is easily credible to the non-ritualistic Eng- lishman. Sunday was much more generally observed as a holiday than I expected. The shops on the Grand Morskaya and the Nevsk Prospekt are almost all shut all Sunday. St Petersburg is not Sabbatarian by any means it is more a day of amusement and of visiting than of devotion, but there seemed to me to be a much more general cessation of labor of Sunday in Russia than either in German; or in France. 8 Address on Receiving a Bunch of High - land Heather in America. 8",

As she stepped outside she caught sight of The Lady Betty disappearing into a small shanty, built on rising ground at the other end of the stockade. She looked about her; none of the boys were near. A sudden impulse-for which the girl could never account, unless it were a simple womanly desire for the sympathy of her own sex at this supreme moment of peril—made her run across the space between the building she occupied and the shanty. She reached the door, which The Lady Betty had left sjar. The girl called her softly. There was no answer, and, pushing the door open,<br>Miriam looked in. There was a square opening for a window at the end of the room, and through this opening poured the golden light of the western sun. It rolled in waves of dazzling radiance into the room, and in the midst of it, bathing her as in a sea of fiery light, stood, rigid still, gazing through the opening, The Lady Betty. She seemed to be seeing a vision, so pale was her face, so staring and fixed her eyes. The girl spoke again gently, but the woman did not stir, and Miriam, stepping half fear  fully, for she did not know how she would be received, went up to her. But as she reached the woman's side, and instinctively followed the gaze of her rapt eyes, an exclamation of awed delight and wonder broke from her lips.

In the deep, sheltered valleys and upon the sunny slopes of these mountains grew till very lately the coffee plants and cinchona trees that yielded the coffee and quinine for which Ceylon has long been famous; but these are now being fast replaced by the glossy green leaves from which is manu- factured the now celebrated \"Cingalese tea\"-a \"survival of the fittest\" which would have charmed Dr. Darwin if he could have lived to see it. \"I doubt very much whether coffee will ever recover itself in these parts,\" said one of the principal planters in the Agra Patana tea country, at whose pretty little country house among the hills of the Talawakele dis- trict we spent a very pleasant week in the course of our travels through the interior of Ceylon. \"But even if it were to regain its old place to-morrow it would always be at a disadvantage as compared with tea for two very good reasons. First and foremost, although tea suffers a good deal from 'red spider and other things of that sort, the diseases of the coffee plant are more numer- ous by far than those of the tea plant, and when they come in earnest they simply mean absolute destruction to the whole crop. Then, too, when a crop of coffee is destroyed or blighted you have nothing more to hope for as regards that year, whereas if anything happens to a growth of tea you will have the comfort of knowing that there will be another 'flush,' as we call it, in 10 days' time, which, if it turns out well, may recoup all your loss and more. \"But it seems to me,\" said I, \"that that particular advantage is confined to the tea of Ceylon itself, for I remember that when we were in the tea growing districts of Northern India a few years ago, the plant- ers told us that there would not be another flush till April, and it was then about the middle of February.\" \"That's very true,\" answered Mr. W., \" and that's just where we Cingalese plant- ers have the advantage of the fellows in Assam and the Kangra Valley; they can only manufacture their tea at stated inter- vals, whereas we can keep on at it all the year round.

Well, I've nothing to complain of at present, although of course I can't do very much in the manufacturing line till I get up that new machinery that I'm waiting for. But so far as the mere growing of the tea is concerned, there's no fault to be found.

But by the time the correspondents arrived the same plantations were yielding fully 1,200 pounds per acre, and the worthy reporters went back again with a considerable enlarge- ment in their ideas of Cingalese tea growing.

And that nothing might be wanting to make this grim picture complete, the caprice of the pest had spared a few plants here and there, to stand as the living among the dead, and mock with their fresh sunny green the dreary bareness of their blighted brethren. But in a sheltered hollow beneath us lies one tolerably large patch of coffee, which seems to have escaped the destroyer, and here a gang of Tamil coolies-about 20 strong, including women and children-are engaged in \"picking.\" One of their num- ber carries on his back a huge basket, into which the others keep emptying the coffee berries from the small panniers slung at their sides; and the group of dusky faces, white turbans, and long brown limbs, mov- ing ceaselessly to and fro among the green leaves and bright scarlet berries, has a very picturesque effect. But every one of the gang, from the biggest coolie down to the smallest boy, works in a spiritless fashion which proclaims more plainly than any words their consciousness that King Chiee reign is over, and that they may in every sense of the work \"take it coolie.\" But Mr. W. goes by this gang with only a few passing words of advice and encour- agement, for the real business of the day lies behind the elbow of the ridge, beyond which the tea plantations begin. Here the picking is being conducted in the same way but there are at least five times as many hands engaged in it, and the briskness with which the work is going forward tells its own story. A little apart from the rest stands a tall man with two crossed sticks hung upon his back, which I conjecture to be a kind of official badge. And so it proves, for Mr. W. points him out to us as the \"kangani\" or rative overseer of the gang, who brings over the coolies from Southern India and lines inten ent planters, receiving a bounty equal to 4 cents per head upon all the laborers engaged. \"It's a great thing to have an experienced overseer,\" says he, \"one who can teach these fellows to do their picking properly, for you have no idea how much harm may be done by careless or clumsy picking. You'll notice that each picker breaks off from every fresh root one leaf, a bud, and the half of another leaf. Now, if in doing so he happens to break the eye of the sprout, leaf will spring from it any more, and when you think how many of these eyes one unskilful picker may break in a single day you can imagine how important it is to have the mands properly trained.\" \"What wages do they get?\" ask I. \"The men 16 cents a day, the women and boys 8, for 10 hours' work. It doesn't sound much to you, I dare say, but I can assure you that according to native ideas it's a very fair rate. Do you see that young girl to our left there, he one with the big silver bangles on her wrists? She's one of the best pickers on the whole estate. She's going to marry one of my native servants next week, and a right good wife she'll make him. Just watch how neatly she brings off those leaves, never breaking nor hurting them a bit. Women are always better than men for this kind of work, because there touch is so light, only of course they cannot do so much work in a day. Look at that man, now, who is picking just in front of us. You would hardly think, see miles if it's an inch. He did, though, and thought very little of it when it was done.\" \"Are these tea plants here full grown?\" I inquire as we pass on. \"Well, they're grown sufficiently to yield a good crop, if that's what you mean; but they're not come to their best yet, nor anything like. We only began planting about three years ago, you know. We consider a tea plant fit for yielding at 2 years old, and after that it goes on increasing till the end of the sixth year, when it is at its hest. We keep on pruning the plants till they're 18 inches high, and when they reach 22 inches we measure them with a cross-stick and pluck everything above the 22-inch level. Now shall we go down to the factory and see how the tea is made chona trees, shooting up straight and slen- der as a fountain jet and then breaking off in one great gush of green leaves, many of which are now dyed with",

In a paper read before the Bombay Nat- ural History Society recently, and publish- ed in its journal, Mr. Inverarity, a noted shikari, discussed the habits of the tiger, and especially the mode in which it kills and eats its prey. Some think he seizes by the throat, others by the nape of the neck from above. Mr. Inverarity has examined scores of slain animals with special reference to this point, and in every case but one the throat was seized from below. Wnether dislocation of the neck takes place is doubt- ful. The tame hunting leopards always kill by pressure on the windpipe, without breaking the skin; possibly the tiger kills in the same way. It is only by accident, if at all, that tigers in killing sever any -- 3 4- important vein or artery, and no blood to speak of flows from the throat wounds. Having killed, the tiger almost invariably begins eating a hind-quarter, consuming one or probably both. Animals are never eaten where they are killed, but are always dragged a short distance. They are not lifted clear of the ground, but dragged. Having gorged himself, the tiger sometimes lies close by his prey, but if it is hot weather and there are hills in the neighborhood he will go a long distance off before resting for the day. He returns next night and finish- es what is left, but he never eats a second<br>time on the same spot, dragging the remains<br>of the prey 40 or 50 yards off. The tiger takes about two hours' steady eating to finish the forequarters of a bullock. Tigers are cannibals; they will make their meals off each other. They are supposed to kill once in five or six days, and no doubt the tiger after a heavy feed does not care to hunt much for a few days; but a tiger kills whenever he can. They have been known to kill on 14 consecutive nights. Mr. Inverarity believes that animals killed by tigers suffer little beyond the panic of a few seconds. The shock produces a stupor and dreaminess in which there is no sense of pain or feeling of terror. The powerful stroke of the fore paw of the tiger is a fiction; he clutches with his claws as one might with the fingers, but does not strike a blow. Tigers wander immense distances at night, and, as they like easy going, they go on roads and paths. They do not like to move during the heat of the day, as the hot ground burns their pads and makes them raw. They can on occasion climb - Qalantta one climbed after a trees. In parsette one cumous most certain Pandoo, but could not reach him and retired. Pandco, thinking the coast clear, got down and ran toward home, but on the way was caught by the tiger and killed. . The inquest report stated that \"Pandoo died of the tiger eating him; there was no other cause of death. Nothing was left except some fingers, which probably belonged to the right or left hand.\" Natives have a belief that the ghosts of the man- eater's victims ride in his head and warn him of danger, or point the way to fresh victims. Nething makes a man se run after as te call him a heretic.

Two fiends in human shape, William Burke and William Hare, deliberately en- tered into a partnership to decoy persons to their houses to murder them in cold blood and sell the bodies to Dr. Knox, lecturer on anatomy at the University of Edinburgh. William Burke was born in County Ty- rene, Ireland, 1792. His parents were poor, but respectable cotters. He was brought nn a Roman Catholic and received a fair PL De Vacationes Changes and and education. He married early and subse- quently deserted his wife, who bore him seven children. Later on he met a woman Helen McDougal by name, while he was working in Scotland. They remained to- gether up to the day of their arrest. Burke worked in Scotland as a laborer and after the harvest of 1827 he, still accompanied the woman McDougal, went to Edinburgh and there met Hare. This man, his ature partner in the series of fearful crimes they jointly perpetrated, at this time kept a low ledging house, in Tenner's Close, Westport.

Here he saw some young students, by whose directions he carried the pension- er's corpse to the dissecting room of the college, having been paid £7 10 for the subject. The death of the pensioner and the profi- table disposition of his remains appears to have suggested to the two miscrean.s the earrying out of the villainous business in which they forthwith engaged. Within the space of a few months they murdered no less than sixteen persons. Barke used to frequent the low public houses of the neighborhood and when he found some way farer without a home or the means of obtaining a shelter he would offer them a lodging at Hare's house or his own. The victim was industriously plied with liquor till he or she became unconcious. Then the two partners in crime wou'd fa'l upon them and while Hare usually choked the poor wretch to death Burke, would throw himself upon the body and thus hasten the end. The two women were undoubtedly the orimes but they invariable privy to the crimes, but they left the room while the murders were being perpetrated.",

      "full_text": "WHAT THE MURDERERS WEER LIKE. Burke was a man of 35, rather below the middle size, but stoutly built and of a deter- mined cast of countenance. His face was round, cheekbones high, with gray eyes, deeply sunk in the head, short snub nose and round chin. His hair and whiskers were of a light, sandy color and his com- plexion fair and slightly freckled. Helen McDougal is described as having been a woman of medium height, thin and sparely made. Her features were long, but by no means displeasing, and were rendered somewhat expressive by a pair of large full black eyes. Hare was about 35, and is said to have been one of the most squalid-looking wretches ever seen in a dock, with a sinister expres- sion, which rendered his appearance pecu- liarly revolting. His wife was a short, stout, round-faced and fresh-complexioned woman, with a look of coarse and determin- ed brutality. Hare appears to have been a rude boor with all the outward appearances of a ruffi- an. Drunken, ferocious and profligate he was far likelier to repel than ensuare vic- tims to their murderous lair. He appears however to have been the more deeply de- signing man of the two and to have over. reached his associate, whom he succeeded in always thrusting forward, probably with the view of disposing of him as he ultim- ately did, sending him to the gallows and bhereby saving his own wretched ne k.\nBurke managed the outdoor business of the partnership for he it was who always went",

This last erime led to the detection of the murderers, their arrest and the trial, conviction and execution of Burke. The woman McDougal was acquitted, Hare saved his neck by turning Queen's evidence and his wife also was used as a witness in the case. The murder of Mrs. Docherty's was discovered by a Mr. and Mrs. Gray, who lodged in Hare's house. They heard a noise as of quareling and fighting after they had retiesd one night and the next day Mrs. Gray found Docherty's body concealed under a heap of straw in Hare's bedroom. After Burke's conviction he made a full confession, in which, however, he sought to show that in each case Hare was the actual murderer as he had been the first one to suggest the execution of the crimes. Accord- ing to Burke's statement the first victim was one Abigail Simpson, a middled-aged woman enticed to the house by Hare's wife. She was carried to Hare's house at night, was induced to drink, went off in a leep sleep and was suffocated in the early merning.

Shortly afterwards Hare fell in with a woman of the town, enticed her to his house, murdered her single handed and carried the body round to the doctor who gave him £8 for it. A cinder gatherer known as \"Effy\" was induced by Burke to enter a stable occupied by Hare. Here she was dosed with whisky. She fell asleep on a truss of hay and the two villains smothered her in the usual way. For this body they received £10. One night Burk encountered a policeman dragging a half-drunken woman to the lock-up. He induced the officer to release her, promising to see her safe home to her lodgings.

      "full_text": "THE TERRIBLE TALE COMPLETED. A woman smothered by Hare while Burke was in the country, and sold for £8, makes up the awful tale of murders to which the wretched man confessed. It is from an ex- ceedingly rare book published in 1829, con taining Burke's confession, and a full ac- count of his trial and conviction, that the the above facts are taken. After Burke was hanged, Hare, with great diffic- ulty, managed to make his way out of the country. Finally, accompanied by his wife, he went to Australia, but in 1855 he returned to Edinburgh alone, a broken down old man, totally blind It was some years before he was recognised. Meanwhile he paraded the streets begging led, by a small dog and carrying a tincup to receive the con- tributions of the benevolent. When he found his identity was discovered he myster- iously disappeared, and has never been heard of since. Dr Koox also gave evidence in the case, and his protestations to the ef- fect that the idea never entered his mind that the subjects had died by violence appears to have been believed by the authori- ties, as no subsequent proceedings were When the woman McDougal was released she, with almost incredible audacity, at once returned to her old haunts in the West Port. She was at once set upon by the peo- that the police watch office, to which she ran for protection, was close at hand, she would probably have been lynched. She was subsequently hunted out of Elinburgh and returned to her native place, Redding, in Stirlingshire. From there she afterwards went to Glasgow and took up her abode with Constantine Burke, her late husband's brother. In Search of Stanley and Emin Pasha. The Germans are evidently disposed to go as quickly as possible now to the relief of Emin Pasha, and the ominous news of the failure of the Barttelot expedition will tend to hurry their preparations. They are also fully bent on moving by way of Zanzi- bar, and evidently would like to have Great Britain's exertions for the rescue either of Stanley or Emin put forth by the Congo route. But Great Britain has also a base of operations on the Zanzibaar side of the continent in her own East African Company and her relations with the Sultan. In such a matter effective co-operation is the main thing, and if the greater hope is to be look- ed for from starting on the eastern coast of Africa it is desirable that more than one expedition should go from there. No doubt eagerness to open a commercial route from the great Nile lakes to the coast is connected with these relief projects, but that does not render the humanitarian considerations less urgent. It is to be regretted on this account tnat bitter opposition has just at this mo- ment broken out among the natives of the interior to the Sultan of Zanzibar and those whom they consider his white allies, direct- ed especially, it would seem, against the Germans. A suggestive accident recently occurred to the Comptesse de Viel Castel. The spirit lamp for making tea burst, and her face and body were enveloped with ignited spirit. She was not seriously burned, though,",

NEAR CANA, Dec. 22.—The Rev. DeWitt Talmage, D.D., preached here t day on \"A Marriage Feast,\" taking f his text John ii., 10: \"Thou hast kept the good wine until now.\" He said: Standing not far off, from the demolish sown of what was once called Cana Galilee, I bethink myself of our Lord's fir manhood miracle, which has been the a conishment of the ages. My visit last wee to that place makes vivid in my mind th beautiful occurrence in Christ's ministr My text brings us to a wedding in th village. It is a wedding in common lif two plain people having pledged each othe hand and heart, and their friends havin come in for congratulation. The joy not the less because there is no preter sion. In each other they find all the futur they want. The daisy on the cup in the table may mean as much as a score of arti tic garlands fresh from the hothouse. Whe a daughter goes off from home with nothing but a plain father's blessing, and a plain mother's love, she is missed as much a though she were a princess. It seems hard after the parents sheltered her for eightee years, that in a few short months her affect tions should have been carried off b another; but motherremembers how it wa in her own case when she was young, an so she braces up until the wedding he passed, and the banqueters are gone, an she has a good cry all alone. Well, we are to-day at the wedding i Cana of Galilee. Jesus and his mothe have been invited. It is evident that ther are more people there than were expected Either some people come who have no Deen invited or more invitations were sen out than it was supposed would be accepted Of course there is not enough supply of wine. You know that there is nothin more embarrassing to a housekeeper than ecant supply. Jesus sees the embarrase ment and He comes up immediately t relieve it.

I wil not now be diverted to the question so ofter discussed in my own country, whether it i right to drink wine. I am describing th scene as it was. When God makes wine H makes the very best wine; and 130 gallon of it standing around in these water-pots- wine so good that the ruler of the feas tasted it and says, \"Why, this is really Better than anything we have had! Thou hast kept the good wine until now.\" Beau tiful miracle! A prize was offered to the person who would write the best essay about the miracle at Cana. Long manu scripts were presented in the competition but a poet won the prize by just this one line descriptive of the miracle: The unconscious water saw its God, and blushed. We learn from this miracle in the first place, that Christ has sympathy with house keepers. You might have thought that Jesus would have said: \"I cannot be bothered with this household deficiency of wine. It is not for Me, Lord of heaven, or earth, to become caterer to this feast. have vaster things than this to attend to.' Not so said Jesus. The wine gave out, and Jesus, by miraculous power, came to the rescue. Does there ever come a scant supply in your household? Have you to make a very close calculation? It is hard work for you to carry on things decently and respect- ably? If so, don't sit down and cry. Don't go out and fret; but go to Him who stood in the house in Cana of Galilee. Pray in the parlor! Pray in the kitchen! Let there be no room in all your house uncon- secrated by the voice of prayer. If you have a microscope, put under it one drop of water, and see the insects floating about; and when you see that God makes them and cares for them, and feeds them, come to the conclusion that He will take care of you and feed you, oh, ye of little faith ! A boy asked if he might sweep the snow from the steps of a house. The lady of the household said : \"Yes; you seem very poor.\" He says: \"I am very poor.\" She pays: \"Don't you sometimes get dis- couraged, and feel that God is going to let you starve?\" The lad looked up in the woman's face and said : \"Do you think God will let me starve when I trust Him, and then do the best I can?\" Enough sheology for older people! Trust in God and do the best you can, Amidst all the morriments of housekeening go to Him . mostimiento or monochechine, go oo man, He will help you control your temper, and supervise your domestics, and entertain your guests, and manage your home econo- mies. There are hundreds of women weak, and nervous, and exhausted with the cares of housekeeping. I commend you to the Lord Jesus Christ as the best adviser, and she most efficient aid, who performed His first miracle to relieve a housekeeper. I learn also from the miracle that Christ does things in abundance. I think a small supply of wine would have made up for the deficiency. I think certainly they must have had enough for half of the guests. One gallon of wine will do; certainly five gal- lons will be enough; certainly ten. But Jesus goes on, and he gives them thirty gallons, and forty gallons, and fifty gallons, and seventy gallons, and one hundred gal- mons, and one nundred and thirty gations of the very best wine. It is just like Him, doing everything on The largest and most generous scale. Does Christ, our Creator, go forth to make leaves? He makes them by the whole forest full; motched like the fern, or silvered like the aspen, or broad like the palm; thickets in the tropics, Oregon forests. Does He go Sorth to make flowers? He makes plenty of shem; they flame from the hedge, they hang from the top of the grapevine in blos- soms, they roll in the blue wave of the violets, they toss their white surf into the spiræa-enough for every child's hand a lower, enough to make for every brow a shaplet, enough with beauty to cover up the ghastliness of all the graves. Does He go forth to create water? He pours it out, not by the cupful, but by a river full, a",

I learn from this miracle that Christ is not impatient with the luxuries of life. I was not necessary that they should have . e that wine. Hundreds of people have been married without any wine. When Chris y made the wine it was not a necessity, but . positive luxury. I think if circumstances , will allow, we have a right to the luxuries e of dress, the luxuries of diet and the luxuries of residence. We can serve Goo 1 drawn by golden-plated harness as certainly as when we go a-foot. Jesus Christ wil t dwell with us under a fine ceiling as well as . get wine made out of wtaer, drink as much of it as you can. f I learn, further, from this miracle, that Christ has no impatience with festal joy otherwise he would not have accepted the would not have done that which increased the hilarity. There may have been many would not have done that which increased he hilarity. There may have been many the miditely. Inche may make book mining in that room who were happy, but there was not one of them that did so much for the joy of the wedding party as Christ Him- self. He was the chief of the banqueters. When the wine gave out He supplied it and so, I take it, He will not deny us the jovs that are positively festal. I think the children of God have more right to laugh than any other people, and to clap their hands as loudly. There is not a single joy denied them that is given to any other people. Christianity does not clip the wings of the soul. Religion does not frost the flowers. What is Christianity? I take it to be simply a proclamation from the throne of God of emancipation for all the enslaved, and if a man accepts all the terms of that proclamation and becomes free, has he not a right to be merry? Sup- pose a lather has an elegant mansion and large grounds, to whom will he give the first privilege of the grounds! Will he say: \"My children, you must not walk through these paths, or sit down under these trees or pluck this fruit. These are for outsiders. They may walk in them.\" No father would say anything like that. He would say, \"The first privileges in all the grounds, and in all my house, shall be for my own children.\" And yet men try to make us believe that God's children are on the limits, and the chief refreshments and enjoyments of life are for outsiders, and not for His own children. It is stark atheism. There is no innocent beverage too rich for God's child to drink; there is no robe too costly for him to wear; there is no hilarity too great for him to indulge in, and no house too splendid for him to live in. Though tribulation and trial and hardship may come on to him, let him rejoice. \"Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous, and again I say rejoice.\" I remark again that Christ comes to us in the hour of our extremity. He knew the wine was giving out before there was any embarrassment or mortification. Why did He not perform the miracle soon ? Why wait until it was all gone, and no help could come from any source, and then come in and perform the miracle? This is Christ's way; and when He did come in, at the hour of extremity, He made first-rate wine, so that they cried out: \"Thou has kept the good wine until now.\" Jesus in the hour of extremity! He seems to prefer that hour. You mourned ever your sins. You could not find the way out. You sat down and said: \"God will not be merciful. He has cast me off;\" but in that, the darkest hour of your history, light broke from the throne, and Jesus said; \"Oh, wanderer, come home. I have seen all thy sorrows. In this, the hour of thy extremity, I offer thee pardon and everlasting life !\"",

      "full_text": "Cantilever. The word cantilever is variously derived from cant, an external angle, and lever (Cas- sell's), and from Latin quanta libra, of what weight (Century Dictionary). The principle of a cantilever bridge is this: Take two see- saws and place them in a line, so that the ends of the two balanced boards shall be some distance apart; weight the outer ends, and lay a board between the inner ends. Now, if you've anchored the outer ends securely, you have a crude cantilever bridge. The piers of the bridge need not be directly under the center of the see-saw boards or cantilevers; they may be more or less under the ends of the cantilevers. The new Niagara bridge is a fair example of a cantilever bridge; the new Forth bridge is a perfect example, be- cause its cantilevers are accurately planned. How to Make a Map. A thorough knowledge of two elements is necessary in order to make a map, with a view to an accurate determination of the positions of places. These elements are lati- tude, or distance from the equator, and longi- tude, or distance east or west of the meridian adopted. Every map, whatever its size, must have some definite relation to the actual size of the globe. The scales of geographical maps range from about 800 miles to an inch (for maps of quarters of the globe) to 10 miles to an inch; those of topographical maps range from 1 inch to 25 inches to a mile. The ord- nance survey of Great Britain is made or mapped on a scale of 1-63,360 of nature, or one inch of paper to one mile of surface. The practice in this country is maintained very Hybrids Not Sterile. Instead of hybrids being sterile, the evi- dence is cumulative that sterile hybrids are the exception. In plants more sterility can be adduced in cases of undoubted species. The dwarf species of robinia, robinia hispida or rose acacia, is almost always sterile, and the well known Chinese wistara is sterile, except un- der special conditions, or in special seasons. Recently Mr. Veitch, the famous hybridizer of London, who has produced a large number of hybrids among a large number of genera, mostly, indeed, so far as is recorded, all fer- tile, produced a hybrid between species of rhododendrons that were themselves hybrids, thus showing that fertility followed through even two generations of hybrids.",

The facts recall the fierce controversy which raged in Europe over the route chosen. It was insisted that Stanley, to reach and re- neve Emin Pasna, should have taken one of three routes-from Mombassa through the British possessions northward to Wadelai; from Bagamoyo, in the German protecto- rate, directly to the Victoria Nyanza and across it, or, thirdly, from Bagamoyo to Lake Tanganyika and thence nortward. After receiving much advice from African explorers, Stanley embarked his expedition from Zanzibar, sailed around the southern part of Africa and up the west coast, and penetrated the country by way of the Congo. To understand his action and its results, a brief historical sketch must be studied. In 1874 the noted \"Chinese\" Gordon began the task of resuing Central Africa from barbarism and slave trade.

Up to the present time it has only been met with in isolated pockets and patches, but now, according to the London Times, the centenary of its discovery has been marked by the ...nding of a continuous lode at the Union mine, Grampound Road, Cornwall, which is believed to be the only known lode in the world. This discovery is regarded as unique in the history of the metal, for the lode is what is known as a true fissure vein, see we of the ore moun as high as 30 ner with moon la or and ore to the we will see on bear cent. It is anticipated that the present discovery will enable two important applications of the metal to be followed up. The first is a substitute for gold in electro-plated ware, masmuch as with platinum and copper it forms two beautiful alloys, each having the appearance of gold, and the former also re- sisting the action of acids. The second appli- cation is in connection with electric insula- tions, where its usefulness consists in its high electrical resistance.",

Armour reconsidered his d termination to ignora Senator Vest'a con mittee and appeared in Washington son time since with his attorneys and clerk His testimony is entirely too long for or columns, being for the most part an essa on cattle production, drawn up by his atto neys. He denies being a member of an combination to decrease prices, and main tains that the decrease is the result of over production-that his profits are not large they being for the year 1888 only $418 104 40 or $1.20 per head on the number of cattle killed. and the second of the second of the second At the conclusion of the reading of th paper the following colleguy occurred; \"There is then,\" Senator Vest asked \"ne combination between yourself and th other packers except one to prevent ruinou loss ?\" \"Yes, that is all. We have such a arrangement with some of our neighbors.\" \"Whom do you mean by your neighbor -Nelse Morris, Swift and Hammond ?\" \"No, Hammond is not in it. Not all the beef men of the country are parties the arrangement.\" \"Well, who are in it?\" \"I do not think, Senator, you care t insist upon my answering that question.\" \"Then you never were in a combinatio with anyone else in buying cattle, or i somme meer or meke . \"No, pir.\" \"What, did you not have a sort of poo of hogs in 1886?\" \"There was an arrangement in 1886 as t hoge, but it did not kill prices. Ther were eighteen men in the the deal, and each one paid in twenty-five for each hog killed That was all.\" \" Have you any arrangement now with your competitors as to prices in certain districts of the country ?\" \"Absolutely none.\" \"Have you any contract or agreemen with other dressed meat men as to division of territory ? \"Senator, I have made a very frank state ment to this committee. As to this ques tion, I beg to be excused.\" \"Is it not a fact that you, Swift and Morris have an arrangement by which contracts to supply Government institu tions-for instance, the National Insen Asylum, of this city-are filled by one o you one week, by another the second, and the last the third week ?\" \"Not to my knowledge. I will say that know but little about such details as that We have an agent in this city, and he might make such a deal as that and I neve know it. But it is not like the principles o the house, and I am sure the parent house would not indorse such conduct on the par of its agent.\" \"Have you any agreement with other houses of any so.t?\" \"Not to my knowledge.\" \"Has your house ever taken any steps to force butchers to buy your beef?\" \"Never put down the prices in order to crowd out a rival?\" \"() aly once at Akron, Ohio.\" \"Never at Pittsburg, or Freeland, Penn- sylvania ? \" No. sir.\" \"I will state to you, Mr. Armour, that is has been testified before this committee that yon sent a certain telegram to Freeland, in which you declared a certain man should be torced to do as you wished. I will read the dispatch: CHICAGO, Da sember 18th .- H. P. LACE, FREELAND, PENNSYLVANIA: Cannot allow Schwab to kill live cattle. If he won't come to our terms, make prices to bring him ARMOUR & Co. around. \"I never sent that dispatch,\" said witness. \"I do not endorse its sentiment, and es- pecially object to its phraseology. Though some of our agents do kill cattle, we do not as a rule like to have them do so. Our position is that they cannot well serve us both. Probably Schwab was about to be- come an sgent of ours, or had been an agent. He is not now.\" \"Have you ever reprimanded the man who sent that dispatch? Is he still in your employ!\" \"Some of the best men I have fall by the wayside once in a while, play poker, or something like that, and I do not dis- charge for it.\" Here Senator Plumb took the witness in hand and brought out the fact that cattle from a large section of the country are taken to Chicago for sale. He asked : \"Is the competition of sellers at Chicago met there by a similar competition of buy. ers?\" \"Yes, there are probably from fifty to one hundred buyers in that market, and the competition between them is fair and keen.' \"Do your buyers compete with those of Swift and Nelse Morris? \"Certainly. They go in and bid on a lot of cattle after Swift's buyer or Morris' buyer has made a bid.\" \"I will inform you, Mr. Armour, that all the cattleman who have been before na say this is not so. They declare the competition of buyers is not a fair composit Do you make dummy bids, taling core not to outbid one another and them divide the cattle purchased at a lower price ?\" r. Armour. \" I state positively,\" said that there never was such a thing as the high man nulling out, leaving the cattle to go to the lowest bidder with a division of spoils afterward among the parties to the bargain. There is just as much competition there in the buying of cattle as there is in the selling of beef and pork. Abuy as cheap as I can and sell as dear as I can and my understanding in that that is what \"Do you know that the wattlemen of the country say there is not fair competition in<br>buying at the Chicago yards?\" cattle to us, just the same. Cattlemen talk so much about the terrible 'big four' that they make themselves believe anything without knowing the facts, but I do net think a majority of the cattlemen believe this charge.

He talked incessantly for upwards of an hour and at the expiration of that time our only General became bored. Fieling in his pocket for a coin, he pro- duced a two-shilling piece, and with some fear that he was grossly insulting his guest offered it to him.

      "full_text": "REINTRODUCED. Washington, January 1 .- Hon. Ben jamin Butterworth, of Cincinnati, has in troduced a bill into Congress. which, i passed, will effectually secure reciprocity between Canada and the United States, so far as the latter is concerned, of a most unrestricted character. Mr. Butterworth was one of the first to realize how im- portant to the country at large would be an extension of its commerce beyond the line of separation between the two countries, and four years ago moved re- solutions with a view of obliterating the customs barrier between the two coun- tries. Ever since that time the matter has had constant attention at his hands, he having spoken in many cities of the United States and Canada in regard to the question. The principal provision of the new bill is in the second section. which reads as follows :- \"That it shall be certified to the President of the United States by the Government of the said Dominion of Canada that, by the a anthonigad The state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of t the admission into the ports of the said Do- minion of all articles of trade and commerce, the growth, produce or manufacture of the United States, free or duty, the President shall make proclamation thereof, and shall likewise proclaim that all articles the growth. produce or manufacture of the sald Dominion of Canada shall be admitted into all the ports of the United States, free of duty, and such articles shall be admitted into ports of the United States free of duty so long as the said Dominion of Canada shall admit the products i of the United States, as herein provided into Live process we seem and white the seems as any wall works  1.7 × 1.0% (787) The Late of the State of the State of the State of the State of the State of the State of the State of the State of the State of the State of the State of the State of the State of the State of the State of the State of th 1,000,000 · 等。 解 等 · 事的 产 新 的 型 左 (1) 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 在1000年度的1000年度中间，1000年度，1000年度，1000年度，1000年度，1000年度，1000年度，1000年度，1000年度，1000年度 发展更加，加强企业，1992年2月2日 - 1992年2月1日 - 1992年2月1日 - 1992年2月1日 - 1992年2月1日 - 1992年2月1日 - 1992年2月1日 - 1992年2月1日 - 1992年2月1日 - 1992年2月1日 - 1992年2月1日 - 1992年2月1日 - 1992年2月1日 - 1992年2月1日 - 1992年2月1日 - 1992年2月1日 - 1992年2月1日 - 1992年2月 STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET, STREET",

In diplomatic circl ce there is a lively discussion of the prospo- 111 of a renewal of the German entente wit II Russia. As Bismarck continues to fin ts the want of homogeneity in the Austria empire, and the growing discord between its various nationalites, and obstacles t good politics, and sees how greatly thes reduce the value of an Austrian alliance it is said he already contemplates a radical change of base in his policy, and specu lates upon a large application of the ide of races that was the basis of so many actionics and projects when Alsace and Lorraine were annexed to Germany. f His new application of the theory o y bringing all Gorman speaking people un der the German flag would be at the ex- pense of both Austria and Russia, but for Russia there would be compensations. The policy, in fact, would wipe out Aus- tria, as that empire now stands, for Ger- many would take the Austro-German duchies, and while Germany would also get the German Baltic province now held by Russia, Russia would get an equivalent in Galicia and Bokhara and would be given a free hand in Roumania and the Balkan countries. The Austrian govern- ment knows this is not merely a diplom- atic idea, but is one of the present possi- bilities of the Chancellor's policy and man of the Chancemor a policy and may become a probability. If the race feuds now pervading the empire, combined with hostility to Germany, shall force the chancellor to project alliances elsewhere.

It was alleged tha defendant gave Routhier a promissery for $250 to induce him to vote for de ant, or to refrain from voting against After reviewing the evidence by wh had been attempted to support this ch His Honor came to the conclusion the accusation was not proved. The so case was that of G. Aubry, who, it suid, had received $50 with defend knowledge, to be spent in bri The evidence showed that Aubry rece $50, but as to the defendant's knowle the evidence was contradictory and court felt bound to give him the be of the doubt. The other two cases r on were also rejected by the court, the result was that the demand for qualification must be rejected. A the acts of agents, however, they numerous and clearly proved.

Neverthe these same persons, some of whom v members of one or other legislature, always eager to vote for even greater st gency which they afterwards pronou impracticable, and when the courts called upon to apply the law, there i general outcry against what is terr an arbitrary interpretation. Ottawa very large county, and if the paymen canvassers was admissible at all, it wo be in such an extensive constituen But section 407 of the act absolut prohibits such payments. In this elect a large sum had been subscribed for penses, and the agents did not seem lear notions of the distinct more rely clear motività or the distille between legal and illegal payments. Ca vassers were employed and paid; cart were paid; committee rooms were hire with more regard to the influence on t proprietors than to the rent; and this I on one side only, but on the part of bo candidates. A patrol was organized Hull whose members received pay each night and a supper, suitably water was served at midnight in a restaurant Hull. All this was done under the ey of the principal members of the ganization, and with their entire approb tion. In the presence of this unrestrict expenditure, it was unnecessary to go i to particular cases, and the court ha no hesitation in declaring the election har more no don nuil. As to the costs, they were no dou enormous, but the defendant had assume the responsibility by his stubborn con testation of the charges made by the pet tioner. He should have consented to the setting aside of the election as soon a sufficient proof had been made. The de mand as to the mis en cause Cormier wa dismissed with costs. Davidson, J .- I fully concur in the judg ment pronounced by the learned presiden of the court. The respondent has been i imminent peril. He escapes because he ha been given the benefit of the doubt. Th case affords an impressive instance of th serious defects which are inherent in th controverted election act of this province The election complained of was upon th 14th September 1001 -- over two years ago yet this petition has only now come to ar gament and judgment. In that interva enough evidence has been put on record to void a dozen elections, but the respon dent would not yield and the petitione would risk nothing. So every one of the corrupt acts charged against respondent's agent's was probed to the bottom, evidence now covering some 700 or 800 printed pa- ges was taken, and all the time the enquete judge sat powerless to close the proceed. ings or to apply a remedy. Authority ought to lie in his hands to summarily end an investigation when sufficient proof has been made to satisfy the purpose of the petition, and he ought also to be able to at once pronounce judgment or, if he chooses, o refer the record to the full bench. The present procedure is disas- trous to the efficient disposal of election petitions and involves one, or other, and sometimes both of the parties, in costs more enormous than any which attach to any other class of litigation. consent to serve For some time past the reports from Russia as to plots against the Czar's life have been very persistent. Disaffection was said to exist in the army, and all the signs pointed to a revival of the dreadful activities of the nihilists. These gloomy tidings are followed by the definite state- ment that the Czar's recent attack of sup- posed influenza was really an attempt to poison him. The unfortunate monarch will now have to provide himself with a taster as did the imperial tyrants of old. Dynamite and poison are not pleasant things for the Russian ruler to contem- plate, but he has at least the satisfaction of reflecting that he has no Grits within the boundaries of his vast dominions.",

Took's Court, Chancery Lane, has not very sunny outlook even on the brightest o days; it is shut in on all sides, except at the narrow entrance, by tall antique houses with dusty shelves over their doorways and dusty stone steps belew. The open window shutters, begrimed with many coatings o onden smoke, are fastened by rusty hock against the walls. Adull wintry patch o sky hangs overhead; and from there a twi light falls upon hurrying figures-with their echoing footsteps and flitting shadows- passing in and out of this old courtyard When the evening becomes still more gloomy, and the patch of sky is a mere patch of black, a dismal street lamp in the centre of the Court threws a glimmer through its dusty panes upon the houses or each side; and where the blinds are not yet drawn, and there is no stronger light to op pose it, this modest gleam enters a room quite boldly. There is one room in particu- lar, in which a young girl is seated over cheerless fire, where this ghost of a light looks in; and it only seems to add to the cheerless surroundings. For the room is small, dingy, and threadbare in ap- pearance. The carpet is worn in places almost to the boards; and there are splashes of ink on the floor, and even on the walls, as if a shower of writing fluid had recently wiien. Although simply dressed in a dark serge, the girl appears out of place in the midst of such obvious poverty. There is little in her look and mapner to suggest contentment, or even submission. The knitted brow, the curl of the pretty lips, the expressive pressure of the fingers against the dark hair, indicate a self-willed and sensitive nature ; and so abscribed is she in her own thoughts, that neither the sound of a peculiar step in the courtyard, nor even the rattling of a latchkey in the door, attracts her attention. It is only when a lean shabby-looking man with a wizened face comes in that the girl starts and glances up. She tries bravely to hide her dejection with a little laugh as she holds out her hand to welcome him to a place beside her on the hearth. \"Dreaming again, Rosa?\"-and while speaking, the man sat down before the fire and began to warm his hands. \"Dreaming again?\" His tone, although reproachful, was not wanting in affection. \"I was wondering,\" said she, while strok- ing a large black cat on the hearthrug at her feet, whether the impressions of my child- hood-the time seems so distant-could be mere fancy? How old was I, dad, when you first took me in?' The man regarded Rosa thoughtfully. \"How old? Between five and six.-But I can't fix a date, my dear,\" he added; \"that's impossible.

And now, as he shifted his reat to the table and leant over a portable desk with his back to the window, it became appear- ent that he and this little parlour must have grown inky and threadbare together. The man s face was sallow and creased like parchment that has been kept in the dusty corner of a lawyer's office for years; and his scanty hair was of a gray dingy colour that might have belonged to a dusty corner too. And yet the man's appearance could scarcely have failed to awaken sympathy. It was kindly in expression, and and there was something irresistibly pathetic in the gray watery eyes. \"Then I am seventeen to-day,\" said the girl-\"or am I eighteen? I think I must be eighteen, dad, 'she went on in a thoughtful mood, \"for some of my dreams, as you call them, seem like reality .- What was the gentleman like?' \"The party was keen-featured.\" Then he added musingly: \"I should know him again among a thousand,\" \"He never told you my name?\" \"Why, no.

He took a quill pen from behind his ear and began to stroke his chin agitatedly, and looked at the girl and then at his deak. \"Rosa,\" said he, presently breaking the silence, \"what is the use, my dear, of thinking so much about the past? It leads to no good; it only makes one wretched.-Not that I've any right to expect,\" he added in an almost humble tone, that removed any suspicion of irony, \"that a young lady born in the lap of luxury -if I may so express myself-could easily lead herself to take a much brighter view of this life.

He hastened to answer her. \"My name is Trench-Sidney Trench. Have I the pleasure to address Miss Norris?' She hesitated a moment before answering; then she looked up into his face and said; \" Me name is Rosa.\" An exclamation nearly escaped him. But at this moment the older clerk came in with a light. It was an antique reading-lamp, of which the glass was broken. Rosa went out, and Abel Norris closed the dcor. \"Pray, be seated, sir;\" and Sidney sat down by the fireside where the girl had been dreaming not many minutes before. Norris placed himself at his desk; he was more at his ease in that position. Taking the quill from his ear, he dipped it in the ick with some show of energy, such is the force of habit; then he waited for Sidney to speak. \"You have had some years' experience.\" the young man suggested, \"in a lawyer's cffi se ?\" \"Fifty, sir; fifty years, and one or two to",

She told us herself that her name was Rosa; and that was all she could tell us, though we questioned her over and over again.\" Sidney Trench, thinking over all that he had learnt from Abel Norris, began to recall to mind in a dreamy way his early boyhood. He had had a playmate in those days-not little sweetheart. She was a child, he could well remember, with dark serious eyes and a willful manner. But he had been sent away to a school in Swi'zerland for three years, and she had gone out of his young life; for when he returned to England she was never spoken of in his presence. But d impressed him deen- an incident, which had impressed him deep ly, had one day occurred. Mr Pilkington had been appointed his guardian by Sidney's father, the late senior partner. It was a grave responsibility. Sidney Trench was a very young; and Mr P.Ikington, even at that time, was getting on in years; and should he die (this was when Sidney was fourteen), all the legal secrets—as fa as Trench, Pilkington, and Trench were roon cerned-would die with him. To read be tween the lines of legal documents which ay in deed-boxes in every corner of the old house would be impossible; and the calamity, if it came about, could only be compared to the loss of a bunch of keys which could never be replaced; for the clients would take their secrets elsewhere, and the great firm would dwindle into comparative insignificance. The very thought of such a mishap—as Sid- ney had been taught to believe in his won- dering boyhood-was enough to shorten his guardian's life. So, one day, in his youthful simplicity, he had ventured to put the quest'on to Mr Pilkington: \" Is my little sweet heart, sir a legal secret;?' For the thought that his guardian might die, and he might never learn what had become of tha child, was the subject which troubled him most. But he had no sooner made this inquiry han he wished he had held his peace; for the follow- ing day Mr Pilkington sent him back to school, though the holidays were only half over. He never again ha the courage to question his guardian. This old dread of Mr Pilkington-though so many years had gone by -recurs to Sidney when he goes that evening to join him in the library; for he is but a boy compared to this aged lawyer, and the fear of offending him is still within him. And yet, if he had yearned in his boy hood to know something about that \"little sweet. heart he is yearning even more now to solve the mystery of her disappearance. Mr. Pilkington is warming his wrinkled hand over the library fire; he looks at the young man under his thick eyebrows. Can Mr. Pilkington have observed-for they had met at dinner an hour or two after Sidney's visit to Took's Court-that Sidney is re- volving some problem in his own mind? Something in the old lawyer's manner as he bends and warms his hand suggests an un- usual sternness. \"Sidney,\" says he, and he voice is stern too-\"sit down and listen to me. -At least,\" he adds as the young man takes a chair beside the hearth-'aisten,",

Smiling at their unsaccessful efforts she volunteered her aid, and, to their extreme surprise, accomplished the feat unassisted, The story reaching the cars of an eager exhibitor, overtures for introducing her to an admiring public were instantly made, and after a few weeks of severe training she made her first appearance. She is indeed a pro- digy, for in adition to her really marvellous strength she is not, like so many wonders, unplessant to look upon, but is extremely fair of form and face.

In a single postscript the Ply- of his choice no fewer than 1,000,000,000,000 kisses, and as such contracts are not infre- quently made in love-letters, it may be well to give a thought to the magnitude of the undertaking.\nWhoever will take the trouble to figure it out will find that even if this amorous man ahould give the lady 15,000 kisses a minute (and we affirm that no person could hope to do more than that), and even if he could keep up this rate of osculation twenty-four hours a day, never pausing to sleep, eat, or take breath, working 365 days every year, it would take him more than 100 years to complete the contract, and by that time, it would be painful to reflect, the ardour of his love may have cooled. Even at the end of 100 years, counting 15,000 kisses a minute, there would remain an undelivered balance of 200,000,000,000, a number which in itself might appal the most industrious. We therefore feel con- strained to advise writers of love letters not to undertake contracts of such magnitude. Esquimalt Graving Dock. It is said that the British Government will soon be asked to contribute to the cost of lengthening the graving dock at Esqui- malt, British Columbia. The amount orgri- naily granted for the construction of this dock was $250,000, and now another $50,000. being just half the sum needed for the work, is applied for. It has been discovered that the dock, which is only 430 feet in length. will not be nearly long enough for the mail steamers which the Canadian Pacific Rail- way Company is constructing, and as the British Government is greately interested in the new mail service it is though that it will not be unwilling to aid in the improve- ment of the dock .- [N.

When the woods become thinned out so that winds sweep them bare, the soil often freezes down so as to kill the trees. No matter how hardy a tree may be, it cannot live when the soil freezes down to the depth of the roots.

It appears that when the Cathedral bell at Braganza, the ancient residence of the Portuguese Royal family, was tolling for the death of Queen Marie 11., mother of the late King Luiz 1, in 1853, it cracked, In 1861 when the castle ensign was hoisted half-mast high at Bragarz 1, on the occasion of the death of King Padro V., brother of the late King, it was torn to pieces immediately by the storm. At the death of King Luiz 1. last month the Cathedral bell again cracked and the castle ensign was again tern to shreds by the wind.",

On the Dominion of Canada being created, among the provinces handed over to the Govern ment was the country known as Prince Rupert's Land, the inhabitants of which had descended from Frenchmen who had intermarried with squaws. The half-breeds objected to being handed over to the control of tue Canadian Government, or, as they them- up a form of government under the leader- ship of a man named Riel, who had been boupset this ridiculous government, as well as to bring Riel to justice that the expedition was sent. Lord Welseley's small army consisted of artillery, infantry and engineers. Then arose the questied how were they to get Canada. The route was 600 miles in length, and a greater portion of this was nothing but a howling wilderness with a large number of lakes. From start to finish there was a great rush, and men, who were only half fed, had to work in a way he had never before or since witnessed. Owing to the difficulties they met with the clothes the men wore became very disreputable; and as the flour which they carried was used the hage total to means their breeches. He was told before bad that the expedition would ever reach its destination, and that if He replied: \"I have been told to go to rort shall get there.\" From start to finish the only stimulant the men had was a drop of tes, and not a man was lost. Lord Wolesley referred in amusing terms to the manners of without drawing breath for half an hour, and had he only been in England he would have been made, at least, a county councilor. Sir William Butler was able to render him invaluable assist- On nearing Fort Garry they found Riel had bolted, and he must confess there was a certain amount of dissapointment among the men at not having a little amusement with the enemy. They then took possession of the fort, raised the Union Jack and gave<br>three cheers for the Queen. That was prac- tically the termination of the expedition, which was accomplished by the combination of disciplined influence, by fine manly British spirit, and with a determination to carry out the mission with which they had been intrusted. It was by such feelings, as that on the part of our soldiers and sailors this great British Empire had been built up, and as long as that feeling existed in the naval and military forces they might never despair of the future of their great empire.

This latest Utopia is nothing less than a scheme by which the ocean shall be robbed of its terrors. Capt.

'While it would, perhaps, be going too far to declare that the realization of such a scheme is impossible, still there are difficulties involved which render it quite impracticable and improbable. Chief among these is the financial question. Though syndicates abound and millions of money are represented as being paid for this and the other industry, it is doubtful whether our modern Cræsuses could be induced to undertake any project which is so purely an experiment. It is not so sure a thing as buy- ing up breweries, distilleries and such like. Therefore until this question of cash is satis- factorily settled it will be just as well for those who seek summer resorts not to pre- maturely felicitate themselves upon the comforts and pleasures in store for them.",

      "full_text": "LASHED INTO WEALTH. Mago's One Hundred Lushes Started His Five Million Dolla's. John James Mago, a middle aged, well dressed man, has been in San Francisco, says the \"Examiner\" of that city, for a few days waiting for the Mexican steam or to sail. H looks prosaic, but his career is as romantic as that of Monte Cristo. Mago is now o Guatemalan millionaire, who lives nine months of the year at Paris. Fifteen years ago he was a poor Eaglish collector of insects in Guatemala, and also acted as British Vice Consul at San Jose. One day Commandant Gonzales ordered Mago to appear before him. Mago sent word he would come in a short time. This incensed the commandant, who was ugly with drink, and he sent a file of soldiers after Mago, and when the bug collector appeared ordered seventy five lash- es laid on his bare back. This was done thoroughly, and when finished Gozzales shouted: \"Give him twenty five more for lack.\" When Mago recovered, which was only after careful nursing, as his back was badly cut up, he made formal complaint to the British Government, The result was Gaute- mala was ordered to punish Gonzales, and to pay Mago $500 for every lash he received. In default of this English cruisers would shell San Jose and other coast cities. Guatemala readily punished Gonz sles, but tried hard to evade paying $50,000 to Mago. The Brit- ish, however, were inexorable, and the poor bug collector was made a rich man in one day. As he had more coin than any one in the country then President Barries entered into partnership with him. Mago became one of the largest coffee planters and also secured the exclusive fran- chise for building docks along the ports. No one can land on or leave one of these docks without paying $2 toll to Mago, while he also levies a tax on all freight. He also owns valuable mines and tracts of timber. His fortune is estimated at $5,000,- 000, all due to 100 lashes on his back. Mastering A Book. The book which makes a man think most is the book which strikes the deepest root in his memory and understanding. One of the educational maxims of the Jesuits is Vexatio dat intettectum [Hard labor gives discern- ment]. The maxim indicates that in the judgment of these educators it is not working at the easy but at the difficult mental task that gives intellectual perception. Men walk through a mountainous country not only for the pleasure to be derived from the scenery, but for the sake of the physical vigor which comes from climbing bills. The man who masters a book which keeps his mind on the stretch is, like the mountain- climber, braced up by the effort. He lays down the book refreshed, invigorated, and trained to master a more diment book. One day while skating, an English boy dis placed his knee-cap. He was taken home, and the surgeon ordered him to lie for three months on his mother's sofa. He suffered severely from the pain, and his wise grandfather handed him\" a book to puzzle over,\" that his attention might be taken from the injured knee. It was a work on trigonometry, of which Henry Woodrow, the boy of sixteen, knew nothing. At the end of three months, when the boy was allowed to leave the sofa, he had mastered the book, without any assist- ance from any one, and in spite of the severe pain in his knee. Several years after the boy went to Cam- bridge, where he did so well in mathematics as to gain the rank of Fourteenth Wrangler. He went out to India, and, as Director of Public Instruction in one of the provinces, did such good work that he was called \"the Nestor of Education in Bengal,\" and when he died the natives raised three thousand five hundred dollars to place his bust in Caius College, Cambridge, and in the Uni- versity of Calcutta. The Bengal educator used to say that his success at Cambridge and India was due to his mastering the book his grandfather gaze him \"to puzzle over,\" when laid up with a displaced knee-cap <b>建筑上的东</b>东 Force in Silence. In painting the great picture of the sacri fice of Iphigenia the artist, it is sail, exhaust- ed the emotions of grief and horror in the faces of the bystanders. \"He has left nothing unsaid. How can he depict her father's sorrow ?\" asked anxiously his friends who were watching the develop- ment of the picture. He threw a mantle over Agamempon's face. The blank stlence was more effective than any pictured woe. One of the most extraordinary effects pro- duced by absolute silence is recorded in the reports of a Convention in which the fore- most men in Virginia took part. John Randolph had a measure to carry in which he looked for the opposition of Alexander Campbell, afterward founder of a large sect. a man then noted for his scholarship and power in debate. Randolph had never seen the Scotch logi- cian, but he had heard enough of him to make him and his partisans uneasy. When, therefore, the gaunt stranger first rose to speak in the Convention, Randolph looked at him with such an air of alarm as to at- tract the whole attention of the Convention, and as he glanced around seemed to be ask- ing for sympathy in his coming defeat. He then composed himself to listen in rapt at- tention. Campbell, aware of this by-play, hesitated and lost the thread of his argument. Ran- dolph's face by turns as he listened expressed weariness, indifference, and finally unspeak- able contempt. He leaned back and yawned. Campbell sat down hastily. He had lost",

Thomas E lison, the phenomenal inventor, has reached a critical stage in his career, and it would be a strange sarces n of fate, if his latest invention should make him posi- tively abborrent to the growing generation. Over in his lab ratory at L'ewellyn park is this invention. It has been tried and found perfect, and it is a phonographic clock which, instead of chiming the hours, calls them out at every quarter in a voice full of clearness. It may be fitted with any set to suit the purposes for which it may be in- tended. To a reporter it was exhibited The inventor was cheery and playful, as he always is. \"The clock, said he, \"i warmon's to th with ambinaginal wire it to mare out a rie are market now it might save you reporter a great deal of worriment. For instance and, you are at a political meeting with a' dezan speakers carded. They are to have a half hour. You know what a fiction that is. Bat now, if you had a clock like this, see how it would work,\" and here Mr. Edison place i a set within it. He pointed the hand to the quarter of an hour, and a voice came ringing out : \"This speaker is half through.\" At the half hour the clock blurted out : \"The audience will please not encore. The gentleman now gives way to another.' \"The only fear I have,\" continued Mr. Elisop, \"is that the young unmarried folks may not relish it. You are married? No? Well, I don's give this out as a bribe, but when you get entargled in the prelim. inaries come to me and I will give you one that you may present to the family into which you aspire to be admitted. It will be a fibber. I'm a little in doubt about the popularity of the parlor clock with the younger people.\" Mr. Edison has good reason to fear. A more tantalizing ornarent to a pair of ar- dent lovers than a matrimonial parlor phone- graphic clock cannot be imagined. Fancy, for instance, a Sunday evening in a cczy parlor with two hearts beating as one, start- led by a voice from the mantel : - \" Good night, a fond good night. In another hour it will be midnight.\" Then dolefully at a quarter past and each succeeding quarter comes cut its hoarse creakings, until 11.55, when it blurts out :- \"In five minutes more it will be to mor- row,\" and every ten minutes subsequently the sir is filled with its mandling, such as :",

An anecdate which is told of the \"An- gelus,\" Millet's greatest work, which was lately brought to America, may interest our readers. After the picture was first sketched in, a friend of the artist stood observing it. \"How does the meaning strike you?\" said Millet, who had previously declared that he intended by this picture to express the truest worship. The painter's own faith was as simple as that of a child and firm as that of a wise wan.\n\n\"It means to me,\" said his friend, \"that there is no use in prayer. There stand the worehipping peasants on their dull fields<br>beneath a dumb black sky. Where is their<br>answer?\" Millet smiled, and with a few strokes of his brush brought in a ray of sunlight from the horizon. The whole gray sky lifted and arched itself; the landscape from that one beam was filled with hope and promise. The commonest house decorator, follow- ing the same rule, will tell you to light the inside edges of your roof if you wish the whole dwelling to appear lofty and cheerful to its inmates. Cannot our shrewd young readers gather some hint from this for their daily occupa- tions? If the every-day routine of your life is low-hurg, dull and gray, like Miller's fields, let in some cheerful beam of light upon it. Any monotonous occupation or round of duties, however good or useful, wears on the brain and nerves, and produces irritability and ill humor. There are mornings on which every member of a family appears at break. fast under a cloud, the result, perhaps, of overwork, dyspapsia, or some secret trouble. How is the beam of light to be let in, and the whole horizon of the day lifted? If there is an artist in human nature in the household with good will ar ... ot, he or she will contrive some little gayety for the even- ing, or an hour's stroll into the country, or will bring home a good novel. Any amuse- ment will answer which changes the current of thought and recreates the wasted powers. If your ordinary occupation brings you in- to contact with masses of people, treat your- self to a balmy interval of solitude; or, if, on the contrary, you are too much alone, go into a crowd. There is a magnetism, a stimulant, which reaches us from human beings, more powerful than any tonic. Tuese are small rays or night, yes is is surprising how quickly they lift our horizon and widen our day. At best, however, they are but homely, practical methods which serve only a tran- sient purpose. Every one of our readers whose life is hopelessly dull and dead, surely knows how to open it to the one true Light. He Has Magnetic Fingers. The scientists connected with the Johns Hopkins University are engaged in investig- ating the peculiar powers possessed by the fingers of Louis Hamburger, the 21-year-old son of Philip Hamburger, a well-known mer- chant of New York. When the hands of the young man are thoroughly dried and touched to any polished object they hold it like a magnet. He can thus raise up a quantity of pins which will dangle from them, his index fingers possessing the quality more than any others. He also raises up a glass tuoe freighted with a six pound weight. Profes- sor William Simon has him in charge, and proposes to give some scientific experiments befere the Johns Hopkins Scientin Associ- ation.",

I feel sure that among our many readers some women are to be found who do, along with sewing, cooking, sweeping, etc., the washing for their tamilies. While it is hard enough to do the washing any time in the year, it becomes infinitely worse during the winter months. The risk to be taken then is incalculable. The winter washings have been the finding an early grave. Call it a dispensa-<br>tion of Previdence if you will, I call it a result of hot steam from the tubs, combined with carelessness. Rather strong language, I know, but if you had seen, as I have, seemingly sensible women go from the steam-heated wash room to the clothes-line in one hard, and tweed in the lace of a Folth. ern or southern wind, proceed to hang up the weekly washing without having taken other precaution that to pin a shawl or some other light wrap over their heads, you would certainly agree with me that stronger things might be soid. If a mother does not care enough for herself to try to preserve her health, she should at least do so for her children's sake. But the washing must be done. Certainly, the washing must be done in winter as well as summer ; but why not exercise a little pru- dence? In the first place, the wash-room, usually the kitchen, ought not to become so heated by steam; the outside door should be left open, slightly, to admit cold air, or opened wide when the clothes are being taken from the boiler. But the laundress must not stand in the draught. Then when the clothes are ready for the line, I would urge you to let the \"gude mon\" hang them out; true he may not hang them as scienti- fically as you would, but you should be satis. fied. His hands are not so susceptible to cold as yours are. Indeed, I think it will hurt no man to help his wife wash when her one pair of hands must do so much. It will be better, much better for you to dry your clothes in the bouse. An attic to dry clothes in is a luxury possessed by few. Now, if you do not have your clothes dried in the house, and if there is no one to assist you, then do take some care of yourself. Pall down your sleeves. put a cloak on—a shawl will not do, for when you raise your arms it blows back, allowing the cold to strike you over the chest and langs. Put overshoes on, wrap something warm about your head, and wear mittens of cotton flannel or white yarn, if you can use them, and tie a silk handkerchief, or something equally close over your mouth. I make this emphatic for the reason that it is a precaution rarely taken, and yet it is a most necessary one. When one is warm, respiration is more rapid, and it seems as though air could not be taken in the lungs fast enough through the nestrils; the result is that breashing is done through the mouth, and the air as it were. The cold air striking the heated lungs will certainly bring on some de- rangement, and having the mouth tied up, thus compelling the nestrils to do their own work, cannot, you see, be otherwise than advantageous. We cannot afford to run any risks where health is concerned. Another thing I would urge is the wearing of woolen dresses during the winter. So many women wear calico and singham dress- es, which are sure to find their way to the wash every week, making additional work. A flannel or cashmere dress, after having been worn for best until it begins to look shabby, can often be made to do service as an every-day dress for one winter, any way, sometimes for two winters, and need not be in the wash, either, if one is careful. Many women who do their own work buy half wool dresses for every day. They of course line them all through. Mach of the so-called \"cheap dress goods\" will give as much wear as the more expensive goods. Of course it is closely woven goods that wear best. One ought to study how to save washing in winter.

Of course the doctor was pleased with the gift and ordered it tabled. You can imagine the astonishment of all when it was opened to find within a silk-lined case containing a large meerschaum pipe and cigar holder, all in good order, too. It was a genuine carp, imported from Germany, of the variety called papier mache.

It has often been sug- gested that cyclists could be of great service in times of war if properly drilled and train- ed as soldiers, and many of our regiments actually have cycling divisions. In a recent number of the Wheelman there is published a report of a most interesting inter- view which the editor of that paper has had with Lord Wolseley on the sub- ject.

For some months the indulgent husband gratified his wife's every whim. One day the lady, to carry out some ca- price, asked for a check for so large a sum that the gentleman was disturbed. He saw s that such prodigality, if persisted in, meant n | ruin; but not wishing to grieve his wife by a n | downright refusal, he determined to give her a lesson in finance. He therefore smilingly r remarked that he could not give her a check as usual, but would send up the money from his store. n | arout noon the promised money came, not in crisp bills, as was expected, but in silver dollars, the sum total filling several specie , bags. The wife was first vexed, then amused, and finally, as the afternoon wore away, be- came deeply thoughtful. When her hus- band came home to supper, she took him gently by the arm, and leading him into the room where the ponderous bags of specie were still standing, said : \"My dear, is this the money I asked you for this morning?\" \"It is, my love,\" was the reply. \"And did you have to take this money all in, dollar by dollar, in the course of your business?\" was the next question. \"Yes,\" he answered gently, \"it represents the results of many weeks of hard labor.\" \"Well, then,\" she said, with tearful eyes,",

At one time while I was stamping upon the ground in the effort to warm my extremities, a com- rade said to me, \"If your feet are cold try this.\" He raised his foot from the ground and struck some light blows with his hand upon the upper part of his leg, just above the knee.

Oswald has contributed an article to the Medical Tribune on \"The Night Air Cure,\" in which he maintains that night air from the outside is far more health- ful than the vitiated, disease-laden night air of ordinary human dwellings. In Germany successful experiments have been tried in summer of having patients with pulmonary disorders sleep all night in the open air of the pine woods. At any rate it is all we have to breathe at night, and it had better be fresh and pure as possible. \"Eye-openers and Night-caps.\" A physician, who declares that both the \"eye-opener\" and the \"night-cap\" are very injurious, says that the latter is the less evil of the two. \"When a man,\" he says, \"gets to drinking early in the morning as a regu- lar custom, he is pretty far gone. A drink refore breakfast is a pretty certain indica- tion of a half-dozen before sundown. The effect of a morning drink wears away very shortly, leaving the drinker collapsed just at a time when he is busiest at work, and it is natural for him to drink again to brace himself up. At night, however, while he sleeps, nature repairs the damage, or part of it, which he has done by soaking his stomach with alcohol. If a man must drink, he ought to have sense enough to steer clear of the \"eye-opener.\" It is the last resort among drinkers and is the hardest to tear loose from.\" Air the Bedroom. Will there ever be an end of the need of saying that the room which demands most careful attention is the sleeping apartments. Bedrooms should be light, sunny and spa- cious, and there should be constant change of air, a window, either in the bedroom itself or in adjoining room being partly opened at night. If a chimney passes through the room, a chimney in use, an opening into the chimney covered with one of the simple perforated covers that may be closed at need, makes the next best ventilator to that of the open fireplace of the old days. And now that flannel and cashmere nightgowns are so much used, it will perhaps be easier to persuade people that all-day underwear, yes, particularly and especially the woven be removed Coughing and Sneezing. Coughing can be stopped by pressing on the nerves on the lips in the neighborhood of the nose. Sneezing may be stopped by the same mechanism. Pressing in the neigh- borhood of the ear, right in front of the ear, may stop coughing. It is so also of hic- coughing, but much less so than for sneezing or coughing. Pressing very hard on the top of the mouth is also a means of stopping coughing, and many say the will has im- mense power. There are many other afflic- tions associated with breathing which can be stopped by the same mechanism that stops the heart's action. In spasms of the glottis, which is a terrible thing in children, and also in whooping cough, it is possible to afford relief by throwing cold water on bling the soles of the feet the reet, or by ticking the soies of the reet, the which produces laughter, and at the same time goes to the matter that is producing the spasm, and arrests it almost at once. I would not say that we can always prevent coughing by our will; but in many instances these things are possible, and if you remem- ber that in bronchitis and pneumonia, or any acute affection of the lungs, hacking or coughing greatly increases the trouble at times, you can easily see how important it is for the patient to try to avoid coughing as best he can. Cold and its Victims. As might have been foreseen, the influence of mere exposure upon health and life has been unusually noticeable during the rigor- ous close of the past year. Several cases of reported in the metro- this kind have been reported in the metro politan daily press, and we cannot doubt that their number would be largely increas- ed if the facts respecting this matter were fully known. Discretion in matter of expos- ure is not indeed possible to all; but it might certainly be exercised by, or on be- half of, many persons, especially at the ex- tremes of life, much more commonly than it is. The spectacle of an aged man or infant out of doors in biting weather must in very many cases lack the excuse of necessity. It is, however, where poverty or illness brings privation that the pinch is most felt. The safeguards afforded by food, fire and warm clothing are most difficult of attainment. Yet the poor and their charitable helpers may take heart from the fact that the main- tenance of sufficient artificial warmth does not call for elaborate measures or lavish ex- pense. The hand of brotherly help will cer- tainly be appealed to, but it need not squan- der or exceed in providing such absolute necessaries as fire, plain bedding and flannel underclothes. Food of the simplest is alone requisite, if it be sufficient in amount and warm; while the absence of alcohol is an ex- cellent guarantee for needful economy and for more sustaining provision. Much of this care is within reach of the frugal poor: but the time is fully ripe for charitable or- ganization in relief of their pressing necessi- ties.",

OTTAWA, February-Wordhas been receiv ed here of the death on Wednesday night of Mrs. Barnes, the famous Plum Hollow for tune teller. Mrs. Barnes, during her life, achieved far more than a local reputation as a secress, people coming hundreds of miles to consult her, not only as to what fortune had in store for them but also by those who had met with losses or were about to enter into important undertakings. Many came from New York and other American cities, some from west of the Mississippi. During the fifty years that she was actively engaged in fortune-telling she was consulted by an enormous number of people, and made a vast amount of money. She was about ninety years of age. She lived in a little log cabin in a district called Plum Hollow, about seventeen miles northwest of Brockville. She was a mild-mannered pleasant-voiced and exceedingly intelligent woman and presented none of the witch- like and uncanny appearances usually con- sidered an essential element in connection with successful fortune-telling. Her funeral took place to the Athens Cometery. She claimed to have exercised her alleged occult powers since she was seven years of age. Her father held a commission in the Eng- lish army under George IV and for her di- vining power was christened the \"Star of Connaught.\" by King William IV, who presented her with a gold medal.

As a subject was once remind- ed, who wished to give his sovereign a pair of stockings, \"The Queen of spain has no legs.\" She must not be supposed to walk, talk, or eat like ordinary mortals, and if one cannot escape the inference that she really is like the rest of humanity, surely nothing need be said of it. When Queen Victoria visited Salisbury Cathedral, thirty years ago, there was, of course, a flutter of curiosity and loyalty throughout the town. Even the humblest houses had hung out some sign of rejoicing, and at the White Hart Inn where the queen intended to lunch, the landlady was fluttering about in her best silk, while the servants were gay with white waistcoats and flowers in their button-holes. But that this show of devotion was not merely skin-deep may be guessed from an occurrence of the late afternoon, when the queen had departed. In the coffee-room of the inn were two young men wno were complaining to the waiter because they were not given eels for dinner, although the dish was promised them. The waiter apologized profusely, and remarked, in the way of excuse: \"Her Majesty has been here to-day.\" \"Did Her Majesty eat the eels?\" was the too familiar query, and at this the waiter's loyal soul revolted. \"It's no business of yours or mine, sir, what Her Majesty eats,\" was his dignified To Stop Runaway Horses. A Chicago man has made an invention which will stop the wildest runaway team. He is a livery man. Beneath the driver's box a two-volt dry battery is located. in the top of which are inserted three copper pegs that project from the ends of the lines. Running inside the lines are copper wires forming a circuit through the horses' noses by small polished balls of aluminum which press lightly against the inner sides of the nostrils. The circuit is opened and closed by means of two buttons, one of which can be operated by the driver. Should he be thrown from his seat before he can press the button, another button located beneath the seat inside the carriage can be operated by the occupant. In addition to his device for stopping runaway teams, the inventor has made an electrical stimulator for starting lazy or balky horses and giving them \" style.\" This is operated through the lines also, the current being applied to the horses' sides by copper plates in the back band.

History shows that great emergencies never fail to bring forth a crop of great men In all the notable movements of the past, the international wars and civil conflicts, the social and political upheavals, the intel lectual and religious revolutions, our atten tion is fixed upon one or more prominent individuals who are identified with these movements, and whose name are insepar able from them. The name Cromwell anach in English suggests that turbulent epoch in English history when the people stood up manfully for their rights against both King and Pope. Luther is synonymous with the Protestant Reformation; Garibaldi with the struggles of Italy toward political unification and independence. The name Bacon marks a transition in philosophy from the deductive method-one of the most remarkable changes in history; and Copernicus, ar equally interesting change in the realm of astronomy. The word Alexander is the best representative of the ancient spirit of con- quest, and Wendell Phillips of the opposite modern spirit of personal freedom. And so on throughout the list. Each occasion had its conspicuous man or set of men, who stand out in bold relief because they were men of power-natural-born leaders of their fellow- men. There never was and never will be a time without its great men. If the times are dull, and there is no special demand for pub- lic exercise of their powers, these men may live and die unknown to fame; but they are there for all that, and it takes only a little agitation to bring them out of their obscur- ity and place them in open view. When Rome was in danger of destruction by the Acqui and Volsci the people went instinct- ively to Cincinnatus, who was plowing on his little out-of-the-way farm beyond the Tiber, and forced him to become their lead- er. He threw aside his tunic, and putting on his toga, led them to victory. During our civil crisis a quarter of a century ago, when slavery threatened to demolish the Union, the people did not hesitate long in determining who should command ove courabt a long the ship of State. They caught a long, awkward, raw-boned man in Illinois, and put him at the wheel. And well did Abraham Lincoln honor and fulfil the trust imposed upon him by an appreciative people. 'Tis ever thus in the history of human events. The really great men outstrip their fellows and go to the front, because they are men of might; be- cause they have acquired a mental or moral momentum which carries them through diffi- culties before which the average man is forc- ed to succumb. Our text furnishes us with another such example. The Midianites had surrounded Israel and driven them from their homes into dens and caves. The mountains were full of these human vultures, who watched their prey with wistful eyes and said within them- selves, \"Twill not be long before we shall pounce upon you and eat you up. We are only waiting for you to grow a little weak- er.\" It was under these distressing circum- stances that Gideon was sought by the people of Israel and made dictator. He was a man of valor and might, and for this rea- son they thrust him forward and gave him command. I need not cite further instances of this sort; history is full of them. The few that I have mentioned are illustrations of a general law, which applies with equal force to you and men in our particular spheres of life. We may never be great, as the world counts greatness-that is, we may never become renowned and have our names handed down to posterity for some brilliant achievement; but it is true whatever of suc- cess we do accomplish in any line of work will be largely due to the principle I have at of stored un now. mentioned, namely, that of stored up pow er of some sort, to the accumulation of ener- gy, which can be used at any moment, like money in the bank. I wish to speak upon the principle of mo- memtum in human life and character. We appreciate the value of this principle in the realm of mechanics; let us see if it has not an equal value in the domain of spirit. Take the following examples: Yonder is a teamster coming down the hill with a load- ed wagon. He notices that no sooner does the road reach the bottom of the hill than it leads up over another one, and in order to relieve his patient animal of the superfluous labor he makes use of this simple expedient: When he is a few rods from the bottom of the hill be loosens the reins, applies the whip and acquires a galloping velocity which takes him half way up the opposite hill, and all this is done with scarcely any expenditure of energy. About all the horse has to do do is to keep on his feet; momentum does the rest. It steals a march on both gravity and friction. From this country road let me carry you to a sawmill. You see that circular saw flying round at lightning speed, making hundreds of revolu- tions in a minute. Watch it now as that heavy piece of timber is brought in contact with it. The second that saw strikes its fangs into the wood it utters a shrill war whoop of defiance and keeps up the battle cry until its enemy is rent in twain and carried off to make room for the next victim. The resis- tance which that log of wood offered to those revolving teeth is something enormous; some thing which no one can appreciate until he tries to make his way through that timber with a common handsaw and vet. why is THE LANGE OF THE PARTY OF THE PARTY OF THE PARTY OF THE PARTY OF THE PARTY OF THE PARTY OF THE PARTY OF THE PARTY OF THE PARTY OF THE PARTY OF THE PARTY OF THE PARTY OF THE PARTY OF THE PARTY OF THE PARTY OF THE PARTY OF T it that the circular saw spins through it with ease and leaps out with a final twang of triumph? How does it overcome this tremendous resistance? You say it is steam that drives it through. True enough, but that is only a partial answer. Steam indeed gives the power, but not the uniformity of power which we observe. If you would find the secret of this uniformity you must go into the engine room and look at that massive fly-wheel, weighingtons. When this mighty balance is once set going, its own great mass gives it a momentum that brooks no opposition, and imparts a con- stancy of movement to the entire system of machinery. The buzz-saw, with this pon- derous fly-wheel behind it, can accomplish what it never could with steam alone. One more example. Let me point out to you what is known as a storage battery, an ingenious modern invention for accumulating electricity and holding it in readiness for work. Such a battery is a prodigious power, standing in the stable, as it were, with its harness on, and capable of being brought into action at a moment's notice. It is the best illustration of reserve power that phy- sical science affords. Now let us take these hre e examples of accumulated force, and",

It is every man's duty, I claim, to make 3 the most of himself, to be a man of might in whatever sphere of influence God has placed him by catching and condensing the powers at his control and applying then to some noble end. Looking at the average human life, we notice a shameful waste of power, men and women deliberately squan- . 1 dering their energies, physical, intellectus and spiritual, when by the exercise of a lit - tle conscientious economy they might be a hundred fold more powerful than they are and occupy higher stations than they at present enjoy. I never could see any spe- cial beauty in weakness. This quality may ladmiration. It should be the ambition of every one to be strong-a creature of accom- plishment, obeying the commands of God to go forward in his might. I remark in the first place that it is our l duty to develop and husband that peculiar bodily force known as vitality. These bodies of ours are curious machines, in which the vital energy may be gathered up and kept in readiness for the strains of life.\nThey are veritable storage batteries, built upon God's patent, and capable of being charged with a subtler fluid than electricity, and doing a much grander work. There is a great difference in these bodily machines and the amount of vital force stowed away in them. Those who come into the world with vigorous constitutions may thank their ancestors for charging their bat- teries for them and giving them the very Landon best start in life. They are regular Leyder jars stuffed with potential power and des- 1 tined to become forceful factors in the world. Others, less fortunate in their ancestry, per- haps, may thank Providence that their early life was spent in the country, where, 1 during the first score of years, they develop- ed enough vitality to carry them trium- phantly through their three score years and ten. These country boys have great reason to be thankful. They possess in special degree the power of endurance, the capacity for bearing up under the numerous drafts upon their energy. Their vitality is their momen- ern break-neck speed when others less cop- behind. And what a yearning there is in those of us who live in the city for an occasional run into the country! How we ache to get away from crowded quarters and dusty streets; to leave behind us the artificialities of civilization and come into direct contact with the invigorating forces of nature. What a stampede there is for the rural districts during the sultry summer months, where tired humanity may recruit its flagging energies and replenish it- self with sunshine and fresh air. This an- nual exodus country-ward is a deep protest against the physiological transgressions and inconsistences of city life. The body cries out for more sleep, more exercise more simple fare, more green grass and blue sky. All nature invites us to come and catch new strength. And wee to the man who does not respond to this urgent call. I believe it to be a religious duty now and then to in- terrup, our routine work, and fill up with fresh life. I believe in vacation not only for tired ministers, but for everybody. A vacation is like a running jump. When a man wants to make a long and successful leap he goes back a couple of rods to gather impetus. The headway acquired during that brief run sends him flying through the air. Now our vacations do for us what these little runs do for the jumper. They give us momentum enough to keep us flying through the rest of the year. That merchant is unwise who will not give his clerks a couple of weeks vaca- tion during the twelve months. Such recrea- tion will not only put color into their cadaverous cheeks; it will put cheerfulness into their hearts and elasticity into their entire composition. It will brighten them up all over and make them tenfold better workmen. Health is physical momentum; we need to get all of it we possibly can. The man replete with vitality can afford to laugh at disease. Noxious germs can find no abiding place in him. He sheds them as easily as water-proof sheds the rain. Now let us pass from the body to the mind; from the reserve power of vitality to that of discipline. Come back again to that farmer's wagon. You recollect that in order to travel easily over the up-grade in front of him, he whipped up his horse and gathered velocity and power on the down grade. In other words, he looked ahead, and made ready to mount the hill before him. What a lesson here for us who are travelling over the great highways of life. Our courses here are not over level roads which require little expenditure of energy and offer no obstacles to our progress. If I know anything of life it mlantifully provided with un grades T I find it plentifully provided with ap-grade-, and it behooves us sensible beings to prepare for them. To make a success of life, to pass with ease and comfort over the steeps before us, we need a careful mental training as well as bodily vitality. In youth, when travelling is comparatively easy, we should apply the whip to our intellectual faculties and gain that momentum of discipline which shall help us over hard places in days to come. No one can over-estimate the value of mental discipline as a preparative for the graver duties of life. And it matters little where we get this discipline, whether in the school-house and the college, or the more practical sphere of business. The special value of an education lies not in the amount of information picked up in the school room. That is a matter of minor importance, as every scholar will testify. In point of fact, a large proportion of what we learned in school has long since left us and passed into oblivion. We could not retain our hold upon the multiplicity of rules and dates and facts. They slipped away from us be- fore we were 20 years old, and, looking back, we are compelled to say that the best thing our schooling did for us was its training us to think; to apply ourselves to difficult tasks and overcome them; to depend upon our- selves and work out our problems without assistance. It gave exercise to our mental faculties and toughened them, just as the gymnasium develops the muscles of the ath- lete and sends him away a man of might. We may have left most of our information in the school-house, but what of that? The athlete does not carry away the Indian clubs and the rowing machine upon his back, he profits by their use, and comes out a man capable of undertaking any task. Precisely so, the real scholar, instead of cramming himself with multifarious information, trains himself rather to study, to master every subject brought before him whether he re- members it or not; he thus gains the indis- pensible qualities of self-reliance, persever- ance and thoroughness. The man who has these, whether talented or not, is sure to",

It was really his priva- tions and enforced application that gave him the impetus to outstrip his fellows in the race for wealth. He steadily forged 1 ahead, while they, one by one, dropped be- 1 hind. There are blessed compensations in , this world, my friends; no bane but has a  corresponding blessing. The youngman start- ing out at $5 a week thinks himself under- paid, and perhaps he is from the standpoint of dollars and cents; but every day, if he is faithful, he is being paid off in increased efficiency. He is gaining industrial momen- tum, which by and by will pay him twenty or thirty or a hundredfold more than his actual labor's worth. During the first few years of our active, independent life most all of us were obliged to take a good share of our pay in experience. But experience. is a good school. It gives a grand discipline.  And now in closing I wish to say a few  words in reference to the third kind of To be a man of real might, to make an un- qualified success of life, one needs to add a strong moral character to bodily vitality  and intellectual discipline. Nay; this last is worth more than the other two combin- ed. Now character is a growth. It is the result of a gradually accumulated spiritual power. Its force is nothing less than the force of habit. When a man once forms the habit of doing right, and this habit becomes confirmed, he acquires what we may call the mo- mentum of righteousness-aspecies of mo- mentum which is unaffected by temptation. meneticin winds is critical control by company Solicitations to evil have no power to turn such a man out of his course or thwart his progress. Sin is no more to him than the log of wood to the buzz-saw. He cuts right through it and flings the pieces to either side, and the reason is that deep down in his soul is the flywheel of moral principle. To such a man, coming in contact with temptation is a sort of amusement, not a dread encounter. He goes through sin as a matter of course. He has been traveling so long in this one particular direction that he keeps on auto- matically in the same good rut. I know people who, during many years of holy living have acquired such a godly momentum that it is simply impossible now to throw them off the right course. Like the planets of Heav- en, they are true to their orbits. Nothing can overcome the mighty inertia of their holy habit, or cause them to swerve in their faithful revolution around the sun of righteousness. This is in fact the old doctrine of the perseverance of saints. Of what paramount importance is this principle in the education of children! The parent or preceptor who fails to apply it with all his might is guilty before God for a gross breach of trust and wasted opportunity. If we would save our children when the evil days come, as come they will, we must plant these godly habits in them early in life and cultivate them with utmost care. The roots must grow stout and strong and take hold of the rocks before the storm breaks. Your tree cannot do much growing in the thunder- ing gust; remember that. The growing and strengthening must be done beforehand. And what has been said of temptation is licable to our discours coments and also applicable to our discouragements and trials. We need divine power to carry us through these without wavering or doubt; nay, more than that, we need a store that has been accumulating for years through faith. It is a dangerous thing, we are told, for a vessel to lose its headway in a heavy sea. It is liable to get into the trough and be swamped. Equally hazardous is it for a man to lose his faith in God; and many is the poor fellow who, having thus lost his propelling power, has made shipwreck of his immortal soul. I have noticed that when great afflictions come upon them, irreligious men, are often- times very weak. They seem to labor heavily in the tempestuous waters and are at their wits' end, whereas the godly soul mounts the waves as lightly as a clipper ship. In the year 1885, when the Germanic, of the White Star Line, was making her home- ward journey from England to New York, she encountered one of the most terrible gales that ever swept across the Atlantic In the course of this tempest Capt. Kennedy said that a wave of mountainous proportions lifted itself up against the vessel and threat- ened to engulf it. It lay directly in the track of the steamer and stood higher than the top of her smoke-stacks. It was simply impossible for the vessel to override it, and so with her terrific momentum of eighteen miles an hour she plunged headlong into it and was completely buried from stem to stern. That was a moment of awful sus- pense to every person upon that steamer. It seemed as if their end had surely come. The skylights were destroyed and the water rushed in until the passengers stood waist deep in the cabin. One sailor was washed overboard, and the cap- tain in the wheel-house was knocked insen- sible. All the lifeboats were swept bodily away and the iron railing was torn and twisted up like twine. The vessel was lit- erally stripped by the seething waters; but being sharp and heavy, and possessing an irresistible momentum, she actually tun- neled her way through this mountain of water and came out on the other side. She trembled all over, as it conscious of her peril, and staggered beneath her ponderous load; but thanks to her tremendous head- way she burrowed through what to most vessels would have been a watery grave, and shaking off her liquid burden proclaime 1 her victory over this mighty monster of the deep Our trials, dear friends, are like those billows of the sea. We are compelled to meet them, whether we will or not, for in the voyage of life, before we reach the western haven of rest each one of us is certain to have his share of trouble. All afflictions are grievous to be borne, and now and then one comes which makes the soul shiver in every fibre of its being, and threatens it with destruction, Down goes the soul in the dark",

The Assistant Secretary of the United States Department of State says there is no of record any treaty having been agreed upon between the United States and Newfound land.

The humiliation of complete pecuniary a dependence upon their husbands, of being se. obliged to ask for all they have, beyond bare so- bread and meat, which the best and noblest ow of wives now have to endure, the wife of the his year 2000 would never know. Let us suppose, on the other hand, that he ! the heart, remaining untouched, she had preferred to remain single. Would you gain a realization of the posi- tion of the \"old maid\" in the year 2000? If so, look at the lordly bachelor of to-day, the ter hero of romance, the cynosure of the drawing room and of the promenade. Even as that nd bright being, like him self-poised, serenely ny insouciant, free as air, will the \"old maid\" ho of the year 2000 be. It is altogether prob- in able, by the way, that the term \"old maid\" will by that time have fallen into disuse. But while the unmarried woman of the ed a year 2000, whether young or old, will enjoy the dignity and independence of the bache- lor of to-day, the insolent prosperity at pres- ne ent enjoyed by the latter will have passed ld into salutary, if sad, eclipse. No longer pro- fiting by the effect of the pressure of econom- d ic necessity upon woman, to make him in- dispensable, but dependent exclusively upon y his intrinsic attractions, instead of being able to assume the fastidious airs of a sultan sur- g rounded by languishing beauties, he will be fortunate if he can secure by his merits the y smiles of one.<br>In the year In the year 2000 no man, whether lover or husband, may hope to win the favor of maid or wife save by desert. While the poet, just- e ly apprehending the ideal proprieties, has always persisted in representing man at the feet of woman, woman has been, in fact, the dependent and pensioner of man. National- ism will justify the poet and satisfy the etern- al fitness of things by bringing him to his marrow-bones in earnest. But, indeed, we may be sure that in the year 2000 he will need no compulsion to assume that attitude. It implies no disloyalty to the womanhood; of to-day to believe that the personal dignity and moral freedom, unknown before to her sex, which will be the birthright of woman. in the twentieth century, cannot fail to react most favorably upon herself, ennobling her graces, clothing with a new majesty her beauty and making her every way more worthy than ever before of the reverence and devotion of man. There is another and profoundly tragic The second terres broughters A property aspect of the relation of the sexes, which by no means may be passed over in considering what Nationalism will do for womanhood. The same economical pressure which brings the mass of women into a relation of depend- ence upon men, rendered more or less toler- able according to the degree of mutual affec- tion, reduces a great multitude of women, who are not fortunate enough to find ade- quate masculine support, to a form of slavery more morally degrading than any other, and more complete in its indignity. This most ancient form of bondage, which has grown up with the race and flourishes to-day in the face of civilization and Christendom as wide- ly and vigorously as ever, which no wisdom of the economist, no zeal of the philanthrop- ist has ever availed to diminish, National- ism, by the necessary operation of its funda-",

Nov the electors should consider which of the two men is more worthy of confidence Hector McLean, who moved heaven and earth to induce the county to grant the bonus, in which he unfortunately suc ceeded, and then put more than one tenth in his pocket, which comes out of the pockets of the electors; or John Bry son, who never took any part in rivetting it on us, made no money by it, but lost money as well as time in trying to free us of it. Mr. McLean brings no other charge against Mr. Bryson than that of the bon- us; this speaks well for the latter; it shows, too, that if Mr. McLesn has any- thing to say against him it is on some small and quite local matter that he is unwilling to bring forward as he knows it would not be acceptable to the majority of the electors, though it might suit him- self and a few wire pullers well enough. In view of the above facts which he that runs may read, we believe that just now the interests of the county are safer in Bryson's hands than in those of his wor- thy opponent. We rather mefer to trust the man who is not ashamed to say that he will stand by the great statesman who has raised Canada from colonial obscurity to the rank of a great arm of the British Empire, than the man who in his first ad- dress comes out as an Independent, in his second as Independent-Liberal-Conserva- tive, and whom we may expect to hear from in the next Advance as I dependent- Liberal Conservative-Grie National, and who having pledged himself to nothing may without breach of faith exchange his vote for some little subsidy to bring grist to his own mill.",

Dr. Shoard deposed tha death was due to exhaustion when suffering from congestion of the lungs, accelerated by the want of food, exposure, and self neglect. The jury returned a verdict in accordance with the evidence. A startling incident took place at the Central Station, Liverpool, on Monday. An express from Manchester was observed en- tering the station at an unusually high speed, dashed into the stationary buffers at the end of the station, which were shattered, and the engine mounted the main platform. The station was busy at the time, and a nt angued There I scene of great excitement cusucu. Andre were about 300 passengers in the train, but none complained of injuries. The cause of the accident is unknown. The analysis of the registration in Chicago where voters are required to declare the place of their birth when registering, is of interest at the present time. Out of 172,353 voters who registered last fall, 81,172 were native American whites and 3,141 native negroes. Of the 88,061 foreign born voters 32,964 were Germans. Add to these 1,410 Austrians and 622 Swiss, and the total Ger- man-speaking element is represented by 34,. 996 voters out of 171,353, or about 20 per cent. of the whole. The Irish born voters number 19,335; the English, Welsh, and Scotch 7,384, and the Canadians 4,345. The Scandinavians, Swedes, Norwegians, and Danes together were 9,708 strong. There were 3,444 Bohemians registered, and 2,773 Poles. An exciting incident took place at Rich- mond Railway Station the other night. As the up train was entering the station a well- dressed man rushed to the edge of the plat- form, threw his stick on the line, and ex- claiming \"Here goes!\" deliberately jumped in front of the approaching engine. The train passed over him. On, however, a search being made, it was discovered that the man had had a marvellous escape, for beyond a slight cut on the face he had entire- ly escaped injury. At the police station he was identified as a well-known resident named Clifford. A note, in which he intimated his intention of committing suicide, was found upon him. The German Emperor has ordered that a list of officers who took part in the military races Sunday be presented to him. He is very indignant over the matter. It is in contemplation to manufactur- Martini Henry ammunition at the Govern- ment cartridge factory at Quebec this year, Major Prevost, superintendent of the factory. in a report to the Department, says very little is required in the matter of machinery to enable the factory to manufacture Martini- Henry ammunition. Most of the component parts of the cartridge can be made with the present plant, and a few additions at a trifl- ing cost are all that is wanted to meet a de- mand actually existing in this country, and which is sufficiently important to make it worth while adding to the yearly output of the establishment, with a view to reducing as much as possible the general expenses, which must of necessity fall heavily on a limited production. Major Prevost's sug- gestions bear on a point quite distinct from any question of re-armament of the militia with Martini-Heary rifles, which may or may not be contemplated. His proposal is merely to supply a demand which can be met by manufacturing at Quebec what until now has been imported. He says that, if made in Canada, it can be sold to the rifle sasociations at a cheaper rate than the im ported ammunition now costs. The Age of Decay. Birth, growth, maturity, decay, death- such is the norma! history of man. The three periods of life should sustain a certain proportion to each other: twenty years of growth, sixty years of maturity, twenty years of decay. This is what might be counted upon as the ordinary course of human life, but for the fact that we labor under a load of ancestral transgression of physical and moral law, supplemented and intensified by our own personal delinquencies and follies. How pleasant is the picture! Twenty years of happy childhood and youth, sixty years of intellectual progress and achieve- ment, with domestic and social joys, and then twenty years of slow, almost uncons- a decay characterized by sevenity of cious decay, characterized by scremely or mind, pleasing memories, and joyous antici- pations of a grander life beyond the grave. Sadly different is human existe co as we see it. We look with wonder upon Glad- ne, past eighty, still vigorous in body and mand, still strong and wise to lead the great Liberal party of England, We accept threescore and ten as life's natural limit, and expect only labor and sorrow if this limit is passed. We are doomed, we think, by our inherit- ance; and to some extent this is true. But we should remember the law of recuperation. The torn flesh heals; the broken bone re- unites. Diseases tend toward recovery. The weary toiler rises from sleep strong for new labors. The wise physician bases his hopes upon this law. And this tendency of nature to heal her- self may be greatly assisted by careful and intelligent living, so that it is always pos- sible that the man of unfortunate ancestry may secure for himself a good old age, and start his posterity upon an ascending plane. Do what we will, however, life must have its end. When the age of decay is reached, hidden changes are going on, the culmina- tion of which is the last great change. The muscles shrink; the brain shrivels; nerves lose their sensibility and active power; the arteries, perhaps, become chalky orfatty; the heart is weakened; the circulation en- feebled; and at last the end comes. During this final period, then, we must take things calmly; avoid excesses of all kinds; guard against exposures to cold; keep up a degree of mental activity; cultivate cheerfulness, and look forward with hope. At Portsmouth, on Saturday evening, a naval pensioner named Watts shot his wife and then attempted suicide. The parties had been separated for a month, the man work- ing in London and the wife living with her parents at Portsmouth. Watts came from London apparently with a view to reconcili- ation, and saw his wife at her parents' house. Before the interview has lasted ten minutes revolver shots were heard, and it was found that the woman had received two wounds in the head, one in the throat, and one in the breast. Watts was about to shoot himself when his brother seized his arm, and the bullet only penetrated his wrist. He was taken into custody.",

Brock's Administration in Upper Canada- General Brock was appointed president General Brock was appointed president Upper Canada on the 9th October, 1811.<br>On the 2nd December, the same year, he says, in a letter to Sir George Prevost: \"I cannot conceal from your excellency that unless a strong regular force be present to fected nothing effectual can be expected.\" On the 4th February, 1812, Brock opened the session of the Legislature and urged upon the House: 1. A militia supplement- of the Halvage lary Act. 2. The suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. 3. Analien law. 4. The offer of a reward for the apprehension of desert- ers. \"The many doubtful characters in the militia,\" he says in one of his despatches, \"made me anxious to introduce the eath of abjuration into the bill. It was lost by the casting vote of the chairman. The great in- fluence which the numerous settlers from the United States possess over the decisions of the Lower House is truly alarming, and to be diminished.\" The bill for the suspen- sion of the habeas corpus was also beaten by a very trifling majority. Willcocks, Mal- lory and Marcle were all members of this House and leading spirits of the Opposition. When war was declared Brock at once called out the flank companies of the militia. This produced a force on the Niagara frontier of 800 men, who turned out very cheerfully, and he calculated that all over the province the number would amount to about 4,000 men. In the dis- tricts originally settled by the U. E. Loyalists the flank companies were instant- ly completed with volunteers, an almost unanimous disposition to serve being mani- fested, and on these men General Brock seems to have depended to overawe the disaffected and to aid him in the field. In fact he said in answer to an address at Kingston that \"it was the confidence in- spired by the admirable conduct of the York and Lincoln regiments of milita which had induced him to undertake the expedi- tion which terminated in the capture of Detroit.\" These men who were with him ... on he died at Ousenston were the sons when he died at wheenston were the some of the loyal veterans of the revolution. All along the St. Lawrence the same spirit was manifested, the men of Glengarry in particular performing at Chateauguay and in other fights the most brilliant service for Canada. On the 6th July General Brock issued a proclamation, ordering all persons sus- pected of traitorous intercourse with the enemy to be apprehended and treated according to law. His letters are filled with references to his anxiety as to the machinations of the disloyal and disaffect- ed.",

      "full_text": "HULL'S INVASION. On the 12th July General Hull invaded Canada at Sandwich, and the militia in that district behaved very ill. They seemed either to lose hope or to be disaffected. Five hun- dred of them, chiefly of those alien settlers, gave in their adhesion to the enemy, and a party of General Hull's cavalry, amount- ing only to about 50 men, led by a traitor named Watson, a surveyor from Montreal, were able to penetrate eastward as far as Westminster, about 110 miles east of Sand- wich, a conclusive proof of the apathy, to say the least, of the settlers in that district. The Yankee settlers in the Norfolk district also refused to turn out. At this time General Brock called the Parliament together, and on the 27th July, 1812, opened an extra session. In his speech he says, \"A few trations have already joined the enemy; have been suffered to come into the country with impunity, and have been harbored and concealed in the interior. To protect and defend the loyal inhabitants from their machinations is an object worthy of your most serious de- liberation.\" His speech concluded with these well known and memorable words, showing in the face of all his difficulties and dangers, and in the face of overwhelming odds, the true heroism and confidence of a gallant soldier. \"We are engaged in an awful and event- ful contest. By unanimity and despatch in our councils and by vigor in our operations we may teach the enemy this lesson, that a country defended by free men, enthusiastical- ly devoted to the cause of of their King and constitution, can never be conquered.\" Two days later Brock appealed to the militia of this place, the York flank com- panies, whether they would follow him any a province or out of it in defence where in this province of outoffe, in defence of it. The whole force volunteered cheer- fully, without a moment's hesitation. The House, however, refused to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act, or to act as promptly as he desired. The disloyal section, led by Willcocks, assisted by Abraham Marcle, did everything they could to thwart and embar rass General Brock. The state of the country certainly required prompt and vigorous measures, but many of the House of Assembly were seized with apprehensions and endeavored to avoid incurring the in- dignation of the enemy. In consequence of these difficulties Brock, feeling that General Hull's emissaries throughout the country were very numerous and active, called to- gether his excutive council on the 3rd August and made the following representa- tion to them: \"That the House of A sembly, instead of prompt exertions to strengthen his handsf or the government of the militia, providing for security from internal treason by the partial suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, auth- orizing a partial exercise of martial law con- currently with the ordinary course of justice, and placing at his disposal the funds not actually applied of the past appropriation, had consumed eight days in carrying a single measure of party, the repeal of the school bill, and passing an Act for the public dis- closure of treasonable practices before the magistrates should have power to commit without bail. That under these circumstances little could be expected from a prolonged sesssion. The enemy had invaded and taken post in the western district; was multiplying daily his preparations to invade in others; that the militia in a perfect state of insubor-",

The council adjourned till the next day, the 4th August, for deliberation, and then unanimously expressed the opinon that, under the circumstances of the colony, it was expedient from the prorogation of the Assembly that the gereral should proclaim and exercise martial law under authority of his commission from the King. On the 5th Brock prorogued the House and proclaimed martial law. In all probability the action contemplated by General Brock became known on the 4th, for on the 5th, day of prorogation, the loyal party carried in this same House a most spirited and patriotic address to the people of Upper Canada. In this it is stated that the population is deter- minedly hostile to the United States, and \"the few that might be otherwise inclined will find it to their safety to be faithful,\" and calls upon the people to \"deem no sacrifice too costly which secures the enjoy- ment of our happy constitution.\" The outlook must have been very disheart- ening to General Brock when he wrote this minute for the council on the 3rd August. With only a handful of troops and no money or supplies, with a House of Assembly weak and timorous, and containing a few infamous secret traitors, sufficiently influential to de- lay and embarrass every step for the defence of the country; with an invading army with- in our borders, and a portion of the militia in the invaded district mutinous and disloy- al. Mair, the author of Tecumseh, puts in Brock's mouth a fine picture of his difficul- ties and his manly courage: 'Tis true our province taces heavy odds; Of regulars but fifteen hundred men To guard a frontier of a thousand miles; Of volunteers what assistance we can draw From seventy thousand widely scattered souls- A meague showing 'gainst the enemy's, If numbers be the test. But odds lie not In numbers only, but in spirit too. Witness the might of England's little isle! And what made England great will keep her 80- The free soul and the valor of her sons: And what exalts her will sustain you now. If you contain her courage and her faith- So not the odds so much are to be feared As private disaffection, treachery- Those openers of the doors to enemies- And the poor crouching spirit that gives way Ere it is forced to yiela. The turning point was the pro- claiming of martial law on the 5th August. Then Brock was master of the situation, and the change in the prospects in a few days was almost miraculous. That very day the stirring address from the House went forth to the people. The next day Brock left for Amherstburg, arriving there on the 13th at midnight. On the 15th he was at Sandwich, with 330 regulars, 400 militia and 600 In- dians. On the morning of the 16th he cross- ed to the Michigan side of the river with these 1,330 men and captured Detroit, with the whole of Hull's army of 2,500 men and their immense stores and supplies. (Loud applause.) Two or three days after he set out again for York, where he arrived on the 27th August. The success at Detroit, so unexpected as it was, produced an electrical effect through- out Canada. It inspired the timid, fixed the wavering and awed the disloyal. After this event the disaffected saw that it was as much as their property was worth to disobey orders, and what they were at first compell- ed to do, after a little while they did from choice. Aliens were required to take the oath of allegiance or leave the province. Many were sent out of the country, large numbers left on their own account-pass- ports being furnished those desiring to leave.",

When the militia of the London district were ordered out, Smith, the author already re- ferred to, says: \" Many refused of their own accord and thers were persuaded so to refuse by a Mr. Culver and a Mr. Beamer and one more, who rode among the people for six days telling them to stand back. However, they were apprehended and the most of the people be- came obedient. After this they had their choice to go or stay, and some went.\" This power of compelling the traitorous to cease their treason soon bore fruit. Large numbers went to the States, among them three members of Parliament-Joseph Will- cocks, the leader of the Opposition, Benjamin Mallory and Abraham Marcle. At the next session Willcocks and Marcle, who were still members, were expelled the House \"for their disloyal and infamous conduct in having traitorously deserted to the enemy.\" Mallory had not been re-elected in 1812. Willcocks was killed at Fort Erie in 1814 in command of a regiment in the Yankee army -Mallory served during the war as major in the same regiment. Fifteen traitors were tried at Ancaster during the war and sen- tenced to death. Seven of them were hanged together at that place by order of General Drummond and eight were sent to Quebec for punishment. A large number of the disloyal must have been arrested and put in prison very early in the war, for on the day of the battle of Queenston Heights, October 13, 1812, the jail and sourt house at Niagara were filled with political prisoners, as well as the block house in Fort George, amount- ing altogether to over 300 aliens and traitors in custody, with only a few raw militia to guard them.

Canada can never again be called upon to face such dangers and difficulties. It seems impossible that the odds could ever again be anything like so great against us, yet there are too many sons of Canada born upon her soil and too many other men loyal to their sovereign and to the land of their adoption for a small fraction of strangers to be able to seriously endanger the national life.",

His Buried Leg Pained Him. \"That reminds me,\" said the man who is always being reminded of something. \"What is it that reminds you, and what of ?\" \"This item about a man having his leg buried the other day. I wonder if he will have the same experience as a friend of mine. Strangest thing I ever heard of. You see, this poor fellow had suffered untold agony for a year or more after injuring his right leg by falling down stairs, and finally water and the second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second second secon the member became so diseased that ampu- tation was necessary. The man nearly died under the operation, though that is not the interesting part of the story. The removed portion of the leg was taken away and buried. It is well known, of course, to sur- gical science that when a man has had a limb cut off he still suffers, or thinks he suf- fers, pain, which amounts to the same thing, in the part of the member removed. It was so in this case, and as my friend came back to consciousness his constant complaint was of the most severe pain in the buried foot. \"' There is something pressing upon it,\" he would say, in what seemed like delirium. 'It's packed too tightly.' \"Now the sufferer knew nothing of wher or how his lost limb was buried but as e matter of fact, it had been swathed in a lot of hay, packed tightly in a box, and the whole put under ground. Day after day went on, the suffering of the man with the buried leg and foot grew intolerable, until finally he begged his brother to dig up the piece of li'eless flesh, remove its wrappings, and change its position in the box. Only a sick man's whim, thought the brother, who was nursing the unfortunate fellow. Still, why he could never explain, he too was seized with a fancy that if he were to do as the invalid wished, and then tell him about it, the effect might be a relief to the sick man's mind. It's all nonsense, of course, he said to himself, but he went one night, just the same, dug up the limb, relieved it of its wrapping, turned it over in the box, and buried the grewsome thing again, thinking the next morning he would tell his brother all about it. The first thing his brother said to him when he saw him was 'Something queer happened last night.' 'What was that?' 'Well, you know what I have been telling you about my buried limb, how aw- fully it ached, and how it felt as if something was pressing upon it. Well, just about 10 o'clock last night, when the thing was aching its worst, I all at once felt a relief. The pain was completely gone, and I have not felt it since. \"The brother was astonished beyond ex- pression. It was just exactly five minutes before 10 o'clock on the night previous that he had changed the position of the buried limb, and he had not told a living soul of what he had done. Rather curious, isn't it ?\" What Tommy Thought. Tommy passed the parlor door just as his sister and her lover were concluding a con- ference about something, overhearing the remark \"will put our heads together and see what we can do.\" Entering the library he heard his father remark of the spooning pair, \"They're a crack-brained couple, any way.\" \"Guess they're all mended now, pop,\" said Tommy, \"'cause I just heard 'em say they'd put their heads together.\"",

A very simple apparatus for obtaining as electric spark is made by a German physic st. Around the centre of a common lam chimney is pasted a strip of tinfoil, and an other strip from one end of the chimney to within a quarter of an inch of this ring. Their piece of silk is wrapped around a brush and the interior is rubbed briskly. In the dark a bright electric spark may be seen to pass from one piece of tinfoil to the other each time the brush is withdrawn from the chimney. Many other experiments can be tried with this apparatus. Out in Vancouver they are advocating the idea of a great demonstration on the arriva of the Canadian Pacific steamship Empress of India.

      "full_text": "The Ontario Legislature have voted as increase in the salary of the Premier of $2,000 and $1,400 to the leader of the Opposition. A motion to increase the i demnity of individual members from six hundred to eight hundred dollars was withdrawn, on the grounds of unconstitu tionality. Hor. Mr. Mowat and Mr. Meredith have declined to accept an increase in salary. Commenting on the speeches that were made in the House of Commons on the occasion of Mr. White's appointment to the Speakership, the Empire correspond- ent comments as follows : Sir John's ad- dress, while paying a high and just tri- bute to the abilities and qualifications of his nominee, was purely formal in its character. It indicated nothing beyond the fact that the Ministerial party had selected a candidate, and one worthy of the position. Not so with the leader of the Opposition. Hon Mr. Laurier spoke gracefully, but through all his well turu- ed sentences ran a tone of bitterness, and perhaps a ring of defiance. The manner of delivery, more than the words them . mana auttina selves-though tome of these were cutting enough-justify the impression that this session will not be a peaceful one; that brotherly love and forbearance are not to be cardinal points in the Grit doctrine for the next few months; and here it may be said that this morning an intention ex- isted to divide the House on the Speak- eiship. It was known that the British Columbia and a part of the Northwest dole at ous had been d ay d by a la d slide on the C. P. R. West. It was at o e time thought they could not reach Ottawa to day, and the chance to snap a vote was eagerly seized upon. But the scheme ended in disappointment. The C. P. R. rushed a special through on fast time, the members came in during on damed mak the forenoon, and Mr. Laurier dared not force a division on a square Issue; but the respite is not for long. The Grit polic. is frankly announced to be one of ob struction in so many words. Exasperated at their defeat in March, they mean to be an opposition in deed as well as in name; a factious opposition for opposition's sake Afeaucus has already been called. The Grits will meet at ten o'clock to morrow morning, and the means to be adopted in opposing the address to the throne will then be decided upon. The new Speaker made one of the neat est speeches it is possible to imagine. He said just enough, and said it in a tone that justified the inference that in this Parliament, as in the pasr, the debates of with firm the House will be controlled with mill ness as well as with impartiality.

      "full_text": "PROFIT AND LOSS I would like also to lay down this propos ition and make it clear, namely, that men who farm for profit should concern them- selves far more with getting profit by re ducing cost, than by trying to raise the market price. There is only one way in all the world whereby a man can raise for himself with certainty and equity, the market price of anything he sells, and that is by improving its quality. The quality governs to every man the price he may obtain. I will give you an illustra- tion. In all the large cities of the Do- minion butter ranges from 10 to 25 cents a pound. Now, no single farmer, and no combination of farmers can force the but ter market up or down. If it is forced up too much, then the butter that would otherwise go abroad is kept at home : if it is forced down the butter is sent abroad. Thus we cannot influence the market price. But any man can raise himself from being a ten-cent-a-pound-man, by sending to the market just the bulter for which the people will pay to cents. A man can change his place on the scale any time, by improving the quality of his pro- duct to that of superior excellence. Men are always looking for profit at the mark- et end, instead of the home end of their business; and being mistaken in the di- rection of their effort, they have small success. It is folly to keep your cow for six months without getting any pay and then come down on her in the spring and say \"You have got to pay for your board or get out.\" I would have the cow make me a weekly offering, as the churches commend. Most of the churches have good business tact and are managed by men of good sense, and if they had more of it they would be appreciated more than Of I dilet modice of ablacement they are. A man will give a dollar a week to his church when nothing would would induce him to give $50 at one time. Make the cow give a weekly offering. A cow will give more milk if her milking season commences in October than if it begins between March and May. If a cow calves in March or April, when the cold weather comes in the fall she dries up anyway, and therefore boards on the man during the winter too long without paying for her keep. Butter is dearer in autumn and winter; skim milk is worth more, and if our cows generally calved in the fall we would be able to largely de- velop our export trade in dairy products. Butter made in the winter time is worth more and keeps longer; and calves grown at the time are more vigorous and can be attended to more conveniently, as they come at a time when the farmer has leis- ure to devote himself to stock-ras n; practises.",

He used to appear once fresh and fair, Among the youthful crowds. But now behold he's dead and cold. And shrou is around him fold. His cheeks were once like rotes spread. His sparkling eyes so gay, but now we see that he is gone, He could no longer stay, The parents also mourn their loss, Of one they loved so dear, Weep not for Johnie, loving friends, He could stay no longer here. A few short years of trials pass, We reach the shining shore, Where death divided friends at last, Shall meet to part no more. Such holy love inflamed his breast, He would not seek on earth to rest, But strong in faith and patience trod, The narrow way that leads to God.",

      "full_text": "CHAPTER II. When I came down the next mor Aunt Cecilia was already seated at breakfast table. She looked up with a as I came in, and shook her finger at m \"You have grown into a sad slugg child,\" she cried. \"I have been down hour. If you had known how fresh th was blowing through the trees, you w not have tain in bed. I can t imagine w the sweet scent comes from that one in the early morning in town.\" I had no suggestions to make on subject, and so sat down and began breakfast. \"Osmond,\" began aunt hesitatingly, she had watched me for some time in sile \"I have thought over what you said night.\" \" Well ?\" \"It cannot be, my dear boy,\" she speaking with evident exertion. \"I ca tell you why I oppose your wishes; must not ask me.\" \"You have some strong reason.\" \"Naturally, I have, or I should not re what I see you wish so much. Are not the only one I have to love and gratify the whole world?\" \"But I think I ought to understand objected. \"If you have a reason, why tell it to me. You see, aunt, this is a ser matter. It affects my whole life.\" \"It is for that reason I am firm,\" said more gravely than before. \"I k you cannot understand my motives; you must trust me, Osmond. We have co for the first time to one of those differen which will test whether you really love There will be more, but this is one. If can look back on the past, and see grou for confiding in me though you do not und stand what I am doing, all will be well tween us. If not, there is sorrow wait for us both. For both, Osmond; sorer you than for me, probably. - Will you to me, child; will you try to trust me?\" \"I will try,\" I answered; and so the s ject dropped for the time, but I was sor dissatisfied with my aunt's rejection of scheme. I was at that age when w the growth of an independent desire to th for one's self there increases also a dislike accept the judgment of others, even of th most loved and trusted. I was bitterly appointed; a sense of injury rankled in I I felt I was being unjustly dealt with; an went about all that day nursing my ind nation. Aunt Cecilia did not allude again to subject, but she seemed aware that the was a cold shadow between us; and I caug her kind eyes more than once studying face with an anxiously appealing expressi which should have brought me to her for at once, but which caused no other feeli in me at the time than one of petulance being watched. Towards evening I took my hat and we out for a walk. I turned towards Westmin ter, and had hardly set my foot upon t bridge when some one coming behind i thrust his arm through mine, and Sinclai voice saluted me. \"Hullo! is it you?\" I exclaimed. \"He did you get here? Is Calthrop in town?\" \"I have done with Calthrop, he answe ed, shaking his head disdainfully. \"T place was unbearable after you had left. How very odd that I should meet you ju at this moment! Five minutes more and would have been too late.\" \"Too late for what?\" \"Why, to see me !-But tell me, who news you have?\" \"Bad,\" I assured him. \"My aunt won hear of my entering the navy.\" \"Won't she, by Jove!\" Sinclair exclaime \"You know I thought you would find diff culties. Why not?\" \"She won't tell me.\" \"So! And what are you going to do?\" I shrugged my shoulders. \"What can do? Give in, I suppose.\" \"Oh, if you mean to give in, you may a well do it at once, with a good grace,\" Sin clair said contemptuously. His tone stung me, and I asked quickly \"In my place, what would you do?\" \"Not give way, certainly. We walked on for some distance in si ence. At last I asked him : \"Where are you going now?\" \"Why that reminds me,\" he answered \"that this is not my way. I am going to i ortanionon. \" To Portsmouth?\" \"Well, why do you look so astonished! I can't go back to Calthrop; I haven't enough meney to stay in town; I am going to my uncle.\" Then with a sudden pressure of my arm he said: \"Come with me, Osmond. My uncle will be able to help you. I know he took a fancy to you, for he told me so.\" \"I don't see how he can help me,\" I answered. \"If my aunt won't consent, she won't, and there the matter must end. I don't see what you want me to do. And how can I go to Portsmouth? I have no money. We had descended the steps beside St. Thomas's Hospital as we spoke, and were paring slowly along the parade which ex- termis before that building. Sinclair sudden- ly stopped, and leaned back against the river wall, thrusting both hands deep into his trouser-pockets. \"I am going to walk,\" he said lightly. \"Walk!\" I repeated-\" walk to Ports- mouth?\" \"It would take a longer walk than that to exhaust my constitution,\" he said. \"As for yours, of course it is another matter.\" \"If you can do it, I can,\" I said, rather nettled. \"But why not go by train?\" \"Oh, why not go in a carriage-and-pair, or stretched at full length in an ambulance !\" he cried contemptuously. \"Because I'm not a girl, nor an old man.

So if you care to come with me, you may; if not, you may go home and knuckie down to your aunt.\" What tempted me I do not know; but without another word I thrust my arm through Sinclair's and we turned our faces towards the Westminster Bridge Road again. \"You and better send a line to your aunt\" Sinclair said, when we reached the top of the steps; \"don't frighten the old lady unnecessarily.\"",

Sinclair cast himself down on the 't green bank with a heavy sigh of relief an bending over the rippling water, drank h d fill, and washed the dust and perspiration i- from his face. \"This is hot work, eh, Osmond?\" he said brushing away the water from his hair. \"It will be cooler soon, I suppose.\" \"I shall stay here until it is, at anyrate, s | Sinclair answered; and with that he lai a ministen comfortably against the roots an fell asleep.

I was roused by Sinclair, who shook me , violently. \"Wake, Osmond; wake up,\" he cried. \"We have slept so long that the day has gone and the moon is up. Rouse yourself, my boy; it is cool enough now.\" I rose with some difficulty. My limb were cramped and chilled; and I felt hardly less tired than when I had lain down; but Sinclair seemed full of energy. He strode forward hastily on the road. I did not mean to admit that I was nearly exhausted so I set my teeth and followed him. We plodded along the dusty highway for two or three miles, hearing scarcely any sound but that of our own feet, for the country was marvellously still. The road began to rise at last; and we found ourselves on a steep ascent. \"This must be Hindhead,\" Sinclair said. \"I know the Portsmouth road crosses it.\" I had never heard of Hindhead; but at that instant I saw, upon the slope of a vast hollow on the right of the road, a little hut or shelter for cattle. \"Sinclair, I can't go much farther,\" I said. \"We cannot walk all night. Let us sleep there.\" \"You do look pumped out,\" he said good-naturedly. \"And I am tired too .- Well, we will try that hut. The door was open, and mone corner were several bundles of clean straw. We spread the straw a little, and lying down on it, were soon asleep. After some hours of troubled rest I woke with a start. The door of the hut was half open, as we had left it when we lay down, and the bright moonlight streaming through the opening reached almost to the straw on which we lay. I do not know how long I had slept-perhaps a couple of hours; but I was wide awake now, for the restlessness of extreme fatigue had seized on me, and I moved uneasily from side to side, seeking ease in vain. The broad band of light across the floor disquieted me, and drew my legs towards it in spite of myself. At last I rose, and moving quietly, so as not to dis- turb Sinclair, I went to the door of the hut. A light wird had risen, which refreshed me,",

      "full_text": "HEALTH. Poisoned by Cne's Breath When we breathe over and over again the same air, we gradually vitiate it by the con- stant exhalation of carbonic acid, which gradually brings the air up to the point where the difference between it and the blood—as regards the proportions of car- bonic acid-disappears. The blood ceases to be arterialised, and the vital functions are arrested. In vain does the air still con- tain a quantity of life-giving oxygen; the blood cannot take it up, because it cannot get rid of its carbonic acid; the conditions of exchange are absent. To place an animal in air overcharged with carbonic acid, is equivalent to a gradual prevention of his breathing at all. Suffocation results from vitiation of the air in precisely the same manner as from interception of the air. Professor Brown Sequard has recently been making experiments to determine whether the human breath was capable of producing any poisonous effects. From the condensed watery vapor of the expired air he obtained a poisonous liquid which, when injected under the skin of rabbits, produced almost immediate death. He ascertained that this poison was an alkaloid, and not a microbe. The rabbits thus injected died without convulsions, the heart and large blood vessels being engorged with blood. M. Brown-Sequard considers it fully proved that the expired air, both of man and animals, contains a volatile poisonous principle which is much more deleterious than the carbonic it contains. In the reign of King George II., the Rajah af Bengal took some English prisoners in Calcutta, and put 146 of them into a place which has been known since the Indian Mutiny as the \"Black Hole.\" This place was only 18 feet square by 16 feet high, and ventilation was provided for only by two small grated windows out of reach of all. One hundred and twenty-three of the pris- oners died in the night, and most of the sur- vivers were afterwards carried off by putrid fever, due to the fetid atm sphere caused by so many human breaths. Some Not Weather Precepts. Comfort in summer depends almost as much on the food and drink that are taken into the system as on the clothing. If a man is careful about his diet, in particular about what he drinks, he may be reasonably com- fortable in summer, though he sits around all day with a silk hat, a tight-fitting collar, and frock coat. The unpleasant sensations of a hot day come as well from inside the body as outside. The feeling of parching thirst in the throat is more uncomfortable than the direct rays of the sun. The feeling that a man has eaten something that does not agree with him, or has had too many cold drinks, causes greater discomfort than torrents of perspiration. To be comfortable there must be an equilibrium between the interior apparatus of the body and the ex- ternal conditions and circumstance. No man who eats and drinks carelessly on a hot day will have this comfortable poise. A mistake many men make is not to drink until they are thirsty and not to drink anything at all cool until they are hot. A man may get up in the morning and feel fairly comfortable; he will eat his breakfast and drink but little. When he gets to his work it will be warmer and he will be warmer; he will then drink beer, soda water, lemonade, or ice water. In a little while he will be thirstier and he will drink some more of the same. From this time on as the thermometer rises he will become hotter and thirstier. It is not that he has not taken enough fluid to quench any amount of thirst, but that the fluid was not taken until he was thirsty and therefore does not quench his thirst at once. Eating satisfies hunger almost at once, but the food is not taken into the system for several hours, until the digestion and assimilation are completed. It is so with thirst even more than with hunger. Thirst is a local feeling, but it means that there is not enough water in the system. Pouring water down the throat puts water into the stomach, but not into the system for some time afterward, particularly if the water is cold. Coffee and tea quench thirst more rapidly when they are hot than when they are cold, be- cause they are assimilated more quickly. Then after the victim of the heat is loaded up with cold water he begins to perspire more freely. This means that he has put into himself more water that his system de- mands that the heat and is overloaded sys- tem combined are working it off. As the perspiration trickles down his face he goes and takes more drinks, and so keeps the un- comfortable round until night, when he tosses around damp and uncomfortable. In the same way that a short run exhausts a man's breath and makes dim sweat more than a song leisurely walk, so a number of iced drinks poured in rapidly tire a man more and make him sweat more than a mod- erate amount of fluids taken at long inter- vals of time, The best time to drink is in the morning. The stomach is empty and the fluids will be carried through the sys- tem and into the blood more speedily. A pint of moderately cool water then will do more to relieve thirst during theday then ten glasses of beer or soda water in the after- noon. A man is somewhat like a locomotive if the water is not judiciously administered to the boiler there is an explosion. The time to lay in the supply of fluids is before the man starts for the day. If he wants to more he may drink it terry minute and minute the series and slowly, and should not have it so cold that it will inflame the throat and the stomach and make them warmer. A cold bath makes the skin glow with warmth. So a cold bath of ice water in its reaction warms the throat and stomach. Medicinal Qualities of Foods. The medicinal properties of some foods are as definite as their nutritive, and as re- liable as those of drugs; indeed, the phar-<br>maccpæia includes the following so-called foods in its list of official drugs; asparagus, cabbage, carrots, dandelion, endive, garlic Indian-corn, leeks, lettuce, mushrooms, parsnips, sweet-potatoes, sorrel, sea-weeds, tomatoes, the cereals, spices, sweet herbs, sugar, honey molasses, the various berries, the only nuis, animaliats, eggs, oysters, many kinds of fish, nearly all fruits and their jellies and their juices, the wines, cordials, and spirits, the condiments, and salt especi- ally, without which life is insipid indeed.

In the first place the most strict attention should be'paid to cleansing them thoroughly from dust, sand, and injurious worms and insects; careful washing in plenty of cold salted water, with a brush or cloth, will suffice for roots, and careful examination of the leaves of succulent plants; the latter should be left blossom end down in enough salted hour. This will generally destroy all parasite life, so that the small creatures will fall of their own weight to the bottom of the water, unless enfolded between the leaves; therefore cabbage, lettuce, etc., should be carefully inspected before cooking. Soft water in cooking will so far soften the tis- sues of vegetables as to extract much of their juices and valuable salts, unless salt is added to it; and the boiling of peeled vege- tables withdraws much of their potash, the value of which we shall presently see.

October, December and January are still the favorite months, especially December, which heads the list with 1753 weddings. This fact may perhaps be explained by a gentle insinuation that Christmas and wed- ding presents might be considered one and the same. In August there were only 913 weddings.

      "full_text": "The Cunard steamer Aurania arrived at Queenstown at midnight on Sunday from New York, having been delayed for 24 hours over her usual time by a disarrangement of her machinery. On Friday morning she shipped a heavy sea, ane a young man named David Gibson, of Dundee, in endeavouring to avoid it, fell over the starboard rail into the sea and was drowned. A boat could not be launched to rescue him owing to the heavy sea running at the time. A Paris telegram says :- Veys, a shoemak er, suddenly strangled his mistress, Mathilde<br>Hinque, as she was bending over to embrace him on Saturday morning. He then went out and gave himself up to the police, stat- ing that he had intended to poison himself carefully with a strong dose of salts of sor- sant failed rel and petroleum, but that his near laned him at the last moment. He had no fault to find with Mathilde Hinque, and his brain is supposed to have been affected by sun- stroke, from which he had suffered in Mada- gascar. The loneliest man in Europe is Herr Peter Lechner, who is connected with the Weather- Bureau service, and is stationed on the top of the Schonnblick Mountains, in the Aus- trian Alps. There he lives month in and month out, engaged in noting the meteor- ological changes in the highest station in Europe. It is the custom of the villagers on Christmas day to cut their way through the snow-clad valley and up the mountain, carrying presents to the lonely observer. This is the only time throughout the year that Peter Lechner sees a human face. The langua of India have a natron gaint The repers of Thora have a pation same- Piz Johanyan-to whose shrine near Muzaf- fargarh, in Lindh, pilgrimages are now being made. After innumerable prayers to the saint the pilgrims smear themselves with lampblack from his tomb, and the natives declare that cures often result from this treatment. A leper colony resides round the shrine, and the sufferers mix with their neighbors, none of whom have—so it is aver- red-ever been known to contract the disease. A Vienna telegram says :- News received from Parndorf, near Pressburg, states that all the horses in two stables there had to be killed on account of an outbreak of glanders among them. The veterinary surgeon and two farmers to whom the animals belonged were wounded in carrying out this necessary measure, blood poisoning ensuing in all three cases. The veterinary surgeon died last night, and no hope is entertained of the recovery of the two farmers. During a performance at the Bouffe Thea- tre, Paris, on Sunday evening, one of the audience raised a cry of fire. A terrible panic was the result, and a rush was made for the doors. The manager, however, at once came forward and announced that the alarm of fire was unfounded. The audience thereupon became reassured, and after a short interval the performance was resumed. Brother Anselm, who has just died monk and porter at the Monastery of La Grande Chartreuse, had been M. de Bre- court, once well-known in the best Parisian society. M. de Brecourt on coming home from shooting one day fired into a thicket, behind which his daughter happened to be standing, and killed her. In despair he entered La Grande Chartreuse, where he ended his days. The Warsaw papers report that the Vis- tula, having burst its ice, has risen inordin- arily high this spring and overflown the towns and villages lying on its borders. It carried away whole houses and barns on its course to the Baltic Sea. The Polish pea- sants of the inundated districts were depriv- ed of almost all their fowl, which constitutes one of the principal lines of their farming. Chickens and turkeys were drowned by the millions, and whole flocks of ducks and geese were carried off by the high waters. The papers of Kiev Russia report that there is a perfect standstill in the trade of grain in the whole region of the southwest. There is no demand for Russian grain in the foreign market, and prices are so low that farmers would not sell their stock unless they are compelled by the direct necessity. In the Government of Kiev itself almost every line of business depends on the grain trade, and since the latter is at a standstill there is no activity in any department of commerce. The commander of the St. Petersburg police force has issued an order that all Jew- ish stores and business houses should have signs with the names, patronymics, and families of the proprietors written in large showy letters. The cause of this new order, which is the nearest approach to the mediæ- val regulation by which Jews were compelled to wear yellow patches on their garments, is that merchants of the Hebrew taith do not write their names plainly on their signs, in order to avoid the too frequent intrusion of official extortionists and the prejudice of the unreasonable masses. The temperance movement which was re- cently introduced in Russia leads to some very amusing incidents. Listok of Saratov reports the following: Three peasants of the village of Potrovsk pledged themselves not to taste any liquor during the Lent season. The one who should break his pledge made himself liable to a fine of twenty-five rubles or to receive twenty lashes on his naked body. Not many days passed before two of the company found their third associate drink- ing vodka in a grog shop. They required him to pay his fine or submit to the lashing. The former he could not do because he had no money, so he had to accommodate him- self to the latter. He was stripped naked and lashed. But in their ardor his com- panions in the temperance cause forget the count, and administered to him more than the twenty blows that were due him. He calmly put on his clothes after the operation, and claimed that now his companions had broken their pledge, giving him more blows than their agreement had called for. The people assembled in the inn recognized the justice of his claims and adjudged his com- panions to pay their fines or to submit to the same chastisement as he. One of them submitted, and received his twenty blows without a murmur. The other one pre- ferred to pay his fine. Since their agreement had been broken already his 25 rubles were spent on vodka, by which half the village got reeling drunk. 192-275-2078 19-255 A snapper up of unconsidered trifles-a fondling asylum.

Inquiry is made for the best remedy for the apple and pear scab, which so often dis- figures and spoils some of our best fruits. While the selection of such varieties as are generally most free from this disease for planting is important, excellent results are obtained by spraying with the carbonate of copper solution. There are two or three forms of this solution. When the fruit is about the size of a pea, spray thoroughly with a solution made by dissolving 4 oz. of carbonate of copper in a pint and a half of liquid ammonia, in a water pail. When dissolved, pour the liquid into a barrel which is then filled with water. This will spray a dozen or more large trees, and the material will cost only two cents a tree. Spray twice afterward, two weeks apart. Spray strongly covering the leaves thoroughly. A modified preparation is made of 1 lb. of sulphate of cop- per, 2 lbs, of carbonate of soda, a pint and a half of liquid ammonia and 30 gallons of water in a barrel. Dissolve the sulphate of copper and soda in separate vessels and then mix them, add the ammonia and then the barrel of water. This will spray from a dozen to twenty trees according to size. These applications have been used for two or three years with much success, and the trial will be continued. Carbonate of cop- per may be made more cheaply than to pur- chase it at the druggists, by dissolving 3 lbs. of sulphate of copper (blue vitriol) in six gallons of hot water, and 4 lbs. of sal soda in other six gallons of hot water, and stir well on pouring them together.

      "full_text": "Fresh-Water Commerce. Probably there are few people whose atten- tion has not been specially directed to the subject, who are aware of the magnitude of the commerce up on the Great Lakes. It has been asserted that more tons of freight pass through the Detroit River in a year than the total imports of the United States for the same period. The commerce of the Great Lakes is car ried upon more than two thousand vessels, of which more than half are propelled by steam. About six hundred schooners, some of them great four-masted craft, ply on the lakes during the five or six months when the straits and ports are not closed by ice. Many more are small schooners; and of these a large number, on the upper lakes, are own- ed and manned by hardy Norwegian sailors who have emigrated to this country. Steam is gradually displacing the wind as the motive power of the lake traffic, and steel is displacing wood as a material. The steam vessels, too, are constantly increasing in size. In 1886, there were but six steel vessels on the Great Lakes; in 1890 there were sixty-eight. At the same time that these changes in the size and material of vessels are taking place, a change is going on in their ownership. There is a smaller proportion of vessels own- ed by individual or small partnerships . The traffic of the lakes is rapidly coming under the control of corporations possessing large capital. The two great items of frieght in the vast traine of the Great Lakes are ore and grain. Many millions of tons of ore are yearly brought through the Sault Ste, Marie canal down the lakes. Seventy million bushels of wheat and four million bushels of flour go annually by water to Buffalo. The corn ton- nage is still larger. Yet the Great Lakes are closed to naviga- tion during at least six months of the year? and winters have been known when Lakes Superior and Michigan were frozen from shore to shore.",
